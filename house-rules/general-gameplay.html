    <h1>General Gameplay</h1>

    <h2>Alternate Ability Checks</h2>
    While the Dungeon Master may call for a certain ability check, if you can provide a good enough argument you may use a different ability check or a different ability with the same skill. For example, you could make a Strength (Intimidation) check instead of a Charisma (Intimidation) check, or a Charisma (Deception) check instead of a Charisma (Persuasion) check.

    <h2>Don't Track Ammo</h2>
    Unless otherwise specified, don't bother tracking nonmagical ammunition for weapons other than firearms.

    <h2>Helping Outside of Combat</h2>
    When a player uses the help action outside of combat, if the check being made is a skillful check (such as picking a lock or tracking), the helper must be proficient with the skill or tool being used.

    <h2>Hidden Death Saves</h2>
    When death saving throws are rolled, only the DM and the player who rolled will know the result of the death saving throw.

    <h2>Minion Masher</h2>
    On occasion, when fighting large groups of weak enemies, a minion masher system will be implemented where each enemy has a certain number of hits it can take before dying. A critical hit or a particularly damaging hit may count as more than 1 hit.

    <h2>I Know A Guy</h2>
    At any point, at the DM's discretion, a player can declare that "I know a guy". That NPC now exists, and the player rolls a Charisma ability check of their choice to determine how the interaction with the NPC goes. Each player can use this ability three times per campaign.

    <h2>Taking 10</h2>
    If you make a skill check and are not directly threatened by anything, instead of rolling you can "take 10". This means that the result of the check will equal 10 + your modifier.

    <h2>The Fading Spirit</h2>
    If a character is dead, and a resurrection is attempted by a spell or spell effect with longer than a 1 action casting time, a Resurrection Challenge is initiated. Up to 3 members of the adventuring party can offer to contribute to the ritual via a Contribution Skill Check. The DM asks them each to make a skill check based on their form of contribution, with the DC of the check adjusting to how helpful/impactful the DM feels the contribution would be.
    <br><br>
    For example, praying to the god of the devout, fallen character may require an Intelligence (Religion) check at an easy to medium difficulty, where loudly demanding the soul of the fallen to return from the aether may require a Charisma (Intimidation) check at a very hard or nearly impossible difficulty. Advantage and disadvantage can apply here based on how perfect, or off base, the contribution offered is.
    <br><br>
    After all contributions are completed, the DM then rolls a single, final Resurrection success check with no modifier. The base DC for the final resurrection check is 10, increasing by 1 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone (signifying the slow erosion of the soul&apos;s connection to this world). For each successful contribution skill check, this DC is decreased by 3, whereas each failed contribution skill check increases the DC by 1.
    <br><br>
    Upon a successful resurrection check, the player&apos;s soul (should it be willing) will be returned to the body, and the ritual succeeded. On a failed check, the soul does not return and the character is lost.
    <br><br>
    Only the strongest of magical incantations can bypass this resurrection challenge, in the form of the true resurrection or wish spells. These spells can also restore a character to life who was lost due to a failed resurrection ritual.
    <br><br>
    If a spell with a casting time of 1 action is used to attempt to restore life (via the revivify spell or similar effects), no contribution skill checks are allowed. The character casting the spell makes a Rapid Resurrection check, rolling a d20 and adding their spellcasting ability modifier. The DC is 10, increasing by 1 for each previous successful resurrection the character has undergone. On a failure, the character&apos;s soul is not lost, but the resurrection fails and increases any future Resurrection checks&apos; DC by 1. No further attempts can be made to restore this character to life until a resurrection spell with a casting time higher than 1 action is attempted.

    <h2>Throwing Creatures and Objects</h2>
    You can throw any creature or object regardless of size, if you have grappled it and it is under your maximum lifting capacity. The distance depends on how much under your lifting capacity they are, and the damage depends on their weight. The damage type is usually bludgeoning, but can occasionally be a different type depending on the creature or object. For example, a fire elemental would deal fire damage and an axe would deal slashing damage.
    <br><br>
    Conscious creatures with a flying speed have half the range of other creatures, with a minimum range of 5 feet.
    <br><br>
    Throwing a creature or object of a size equal to or larger than your own requires two hands. Regardless of the size, the creature or object is considered an improvised weapon. Creatures or objects with a weight less than your Strength modifier are considered to have the *light* property. Creatures or objects with a weight greater than your Strength score are considered to have the *heavy* property.
    <br><br>
    If you miss, the thrown creature or object takes half of the damage.  If you hit, the target takes the other half of the damage.

    <h3>Throwing Distance</h3>
    In order to determine the normal range of a thrown creature or object, use the following formula, rounded to the nearest amount of 5 feet, with a minimum of 5 feet:
    <br><br>
    \[N = (1 - \frac{W}{L}) * 80\]
    <br><br>
    <div style="text-align: center">
        <em>
        N: normal range, in feet
        <br>
        W: throwee's weight, in pounds
        <br>
        L: thrower's lifting capacity, in pounds
        </em>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    In order to determine the long range, triple the normal range.

    <h3>Throwing Damage</h3>
    In order to determine the damage that throwing that creature deals, use the following formula, rounded down, with a minimum of 1 damage:
    <br><br>
    \[D = \frac{W}{25}\]
    <br><br>
    <div style="text-align: center">
        <em>
        D: damage, in d6s
        <br>
        W: weight of the throwee
        </em>
    </div>

    <h2>Trading Actions Down</h2>
    A character may use an ability that is normally used as a bonus action as an action, but not the other way around.

    <h2>Sprinting</h2>
    You can use both your action and your bonus action to sprint, moving five times your movement speed in a straight line in that turn (or ten times if you have a feature that allows you to Dash as a bonus action). While sprinting, opportunity attacks made against you are made at advantage.

    <h2>Quick Healing Potions</h2>
    Drinking a potion can be done as a bonus action, though it still requires an action to feed a potion to someone else. If you instead use an action to drink a healing potion, you heal the maximum number of hit points possible.
