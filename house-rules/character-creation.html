    <h1>Character Creation</h1>

    <h2>Ability Score Determination</h2>
    Unless otherwise stated, players roll for stats. The method used is 4d6, drop lowest, reroll 1s and 2s. Roll a number of times equal to 1 + the number of ability scores you use, and drop the lowest of the rolls, then assign the rolls however you wish.

    <h2>Starting Equipment</h2>
    Unless otherwise stated, use the starting equipment from your class and background, don't roll for starting wealth.
    <br><br>
    In addition, characters may choose to receive any equipment pack as the equipment pack in their starting equipment, instead of the one normally granted by their class.
