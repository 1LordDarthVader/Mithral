    <h1>Criticals</h1>

    <h2>Critical Hits</h2>
    Adamantine uses the "double the dice" method of critical hits. This means you double the number of damage dice rolled and add modifiers once. For example, if you are using a nonmagical longsword and have a Strength modifier of +5, a critical hit will deal 2d8+5 damage.
    <br><br>
    Dice added through temporary features, such as Divine Smite or Hunter's Mark, are also doubled by this.

    <h2>Critical Saving Throws</h2>
    If a creature is subjected to a saving throw that allows it to take half damage on a successful save, special occurrences happen on critical rolls.
    <br><br>
    A natural 20 will result in the creature taking no damage (as though they had the Evasion feature). A natural 1 will result in the creature taking double the dice of damage.

    <h2>Criticals and Disadvantage</h2>
    Rolling a natural 20 when you have disadvantage will allow you to keep the natural 20, though you lose the critical effects of the natural 20.

    <h2>Critical Cards</h2>
    When a player rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll or saving throw or the DM rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll or saving throw against that player, they gain a critical card. These cards vary in effect, and the effect will be listed on the card.
    <br><br>
    When a player rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll or saving throw or the DM rolls a natural 20, the DM gains a critical card. These work identically to the player's version, though the Fortuitous Circumstance card is useless for the DM.
    <br><br>
    The DM can also award critical cards as awards, similar to Inspiration.
    <br><br>
    Player or DM, each person may only have a maximum of 3 critical cards at any given time. If you are to gain a fourth card, you must discard one of the four.
