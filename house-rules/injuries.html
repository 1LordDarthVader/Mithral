    <h1>Injuries</h1>
    During major combat encounters, such as boss fights, it is possible for creatures to receive permanent injuries. A creature receives an injury in one of the following three ways, but can only receive one injury from any given source of damage.

    <ul>
        <li>The creature drops to 0 hit points</li>
        <li>The creature is hit by a critical hit</li>
        <li>The creature critically fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Resisting an Injury</h2>
    When you are dealt an injury, you can use your reaction to attempt to resist it. If you do so, your Constitution modifier is added to the roll for which injury you receive. If this results in a total above 20, you instead take no injury. You may do this after you know the result of the roll, but before you know which injury you take.

    <h2>Injuries and Multiple Damage Types</h2>
    If you are hit with an attack that deals multiple damage types, the table rolled on will be determined randomly from among the damage types dealt.

    <h2>Injuries and Resistance</h2>
    Injuries are inflicted slightly differently to creatures with damage resistances and vulnerabilities, as follows:

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Resistance:</strong> The DM rolls twice on the relevant injury table and takes the higher number, which will usually result in a less severe injury.</li>
        <li><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> The DM rolls twice on the relevant injury table and takes the lower number, which will usually result in a more severe injury.</li>
    </ul>
