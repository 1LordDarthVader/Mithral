<h1>Firearm Mechanics</h1>

<a href="../../MithralFirearmGenerator.zip">Download Firearm Generator</a>

<h2>Jamming</h2>
When a 1 is rolled on the d20 when making an attack roll with a firearm, the weapon becomes jammed, and the attack misses, but ammunition for this attack is not consumed.. Unjamming a weapon requires spending an amount of time needed to fully reload its magazine as you clear the jam. Unless stated otherwise, firearms have a d4 misfire die. Jammed weapons have a misfire score, which starts at 1. When making an attack roll with a jammed weapon, roll the firearm's misfire die. If you roll equal to or lower than the firearm's current misfire score, it remains jammed. The attack is wasted and the misfire score increases by 1. If a number higher than the firearm's current misfire score is rolled, the firearm unjams itself, and the attack proceeds as normal.

When a firearm's misfire score reaches the maximum value of its misfire die, it becomes permanently jammed until it is manually unjammed by reloading it. A firearm's misfire score is reset back to 1 when it is unjammed.

<h2>Modifying Firearms</h2>
A firearm can be modified with Tinkers' Tools, so long as the user is proficient with them. Attachments can be removed or swapped out over a short rest, or over 10 minutes with a successful DC 15 skill check using Tinkers' Tools. Main Parts such as barrels can be swapped, removed, or added over a workweek minus a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier, to a minimum of one workday.

<h2>Proficiency</h2>
Firearms fall under both the simple and martial categories. For the purposes of becoming proficient with firearms, matchlocks and flintlocks are simple ranged weapons, while the rest (break-action, bolt-action, etc.) are martial ranged weapons. Characters with proficiency in all simple weapons are also proficient in simple firearms. Characters with proficiency in at least one martial ranged weapon are proficient in martial firearms.

<h2>Weight</h2>
A firearm that is is 5 lb. or less is light. A firearm that is 30 lb. or more is heavy, requires a STR score of 13 to use, and uses STR modifier instead of DEX modifier for the attack and damage rolls. For every 10 lb. after 30, the STR requirement increases by 1. For example, a firearm that weighs 50 lb. would require a STR score of 15 to use, and use the STR modifier for attack and damage rolls made with it.

Characters who lack the Strength score requirement for a firearm make all attacks using that firearm at disadvantage.

<h2>Creating Firearms</h2>
A firearm must have a selected class, firing mechanism, body material, barrel, and stock.

<h3>Step 1: Firearm Class</h3>
The weight modifier only applies to the material's weight.

* A blunderbuss that is not matchlock or flintlock is classified as a shotgun.

<h3>Crank Gun</h3>
Marvels of technology and engineering, these special firearms send a flurry of lead downrange, shredding countless opponents to bits. These guns generally must be mounted onto specially made mounts due to their immense weight.

Crank guns fire at an unprecedented rate, though take the longest to reload out of all firearms. For each attack made with a crank gun, the gun fires 6 times. Attack rolls are made for each shot.

Furthermore, While a crank gun is mounted to a crank gun stand, for the purposes of circumventing the gun's heavy property and weight, the wielder is not considered to be carrying the crank gun, so long as the crank gun remains attached to its stand and the wielder is not carrying the stand.

<h3>Step 2: Firing Mechanism</h3>
The cost modifier only applies to the material's cost.

<h4>Rifling</h4>

Barrels can be rifled, meaning that small grooves are carved into their inner walls, putting a spin on the bullet and thus improving accuracy.

Rifling a barrel doubles the cost, but also doubles the normal range and long range of the firearm.

* All barrels must be of the same type, the cost of rifling increases proportionally, and only one barrel-end attachment is allowed

<h3>Attachments</h3>
Attachments are parts that change the gun's statistics. Up to one of each type of attachment may be installed on a given firearm, unless stated otherwise. They count towards the total weight that the Body Material can support. They can be added to or removed from a firearm using Tinkers' Tools.

<h5>Bayonets</h5>
If the total weight of the firearm, including the bayonet, would still be considered light, then the bayonet attack is considered to have the finesse property. If the barrel it is attached to is a pole barrel, the bayonet attack is considered to have the reach property.

Bayonets can also be attached to crossbows.  Large bayonets cannot be attached to hand crossbows.

<h5>Ammunition Belt</h5>
Ammunition belts are how ammunition is delivered into the mechanism of the crank gun. Each ammo belt weighs 20 pounds, which is counted toward to the total weight of the gun while attached to it. Each belt can hold up to 60 pistol cartridges.

Once exhausted, the ammunition belt must be loaded over the course of 10 minutes. An ammunition belt cannot be loaded while attached to a crank gun.

Removing or attaching an ammo belt to a crank gun requires an action. A crank gun may only have one ammo belt attached to it at a time.

<h5>Crank Gun Stand</h5>
A crank gun stand is a special tripod made for supporting crank guns. It stands about three feet tall and has implements and attachment points needed to mount any crank gun to it. Doing so requires five minutes and the use of someone proficient with Tinker's Tools.

<h5>Loaders</h5>



Loaders reduce the time required to reload a firearm. Instead of spending a whole action reloading, you can instead use an item interaction to take the Reload action, taking ammunition from the loader. Loading a loader takes 1 minute.
