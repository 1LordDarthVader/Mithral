<h1>Aberrant Horror</h1>

Aberrant Horrors are the result of a humanoid becoming an aberration. Able to break free from the physical restrictions imposed upon them by the Material Plane, they shift the components of their form at a whim. This makes Aberrant Horrors terrifying to behold, especially in battle. Many adversaries have been caught off-guard  when a seemingly defenceless opponent grew rows of gruesome spines before their eyes.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Constitution 13
<br><br><strong>Roleplay:</strong> You must have had an encounter with an Aberration, magical anomaly, or some other plausible reason to have become an Aberrant Horror. Discuss with your GM how you can achieve this in your backstory or in-game.
<br><br>Some of your abilities will require your target to make a saving throw to resist their effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
<br><br><strong>Transformation Save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

<h2>Milestones</h2>
