<h1>Revenant</h1>

Revenants are created when a creature dies with unfinished business in the mortal world.  Though even still, not all creatures possess the capacity to become a revenant.  Such a transformation requires incredible willpower.  Mostly, a revenant serves their own aims until they are completed, upon which time they die.  However, occasionally, a creature can become a more tragic type of revenant, where a powerful necromancer or otherworldly entity revives them as a servant. Regardless of how you have become a revenant, you should discuss with your GM what type of revenant you would like to become, and how it can be implemented in the campaign.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Constitution 13
<br><br><strong>Roleplay:</strong> You must have died, with a powerful force of either your own willpower or a powerful being's magic pulling you back to the world of the living. Discuss with your GM how you can achieve this in-game.
<br><br><strong>Transformation Save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

<h2>Milestones</h2>

The following are examples of possible level milestones for the Revenant:
<ul>
    <li>Die in battle in the process of completing your goal</li>
    <li>Complete an aspect of your goal, without completing the entire goal</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transformation Level 1</h2>

At 1st level, you gain all of the following boons and flaws.

<h3>Relentless Nature</h3>

You and your DM decide upon a goal for you - typically one related to your character's death.  The goal must be a specific task you can complete, such as slaying an enemy or liberating an area and its people. Until you fulfill that goal, you gain the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>If you are below half your hit point maximum at the start of your turn, you regain 1 hit point.</li>
    <li>If you die, you return to life at full hit points 24 hours after death. If your body is destroyed, you reform within 1 mile of the place of your death at a spot determined by the DM. If your equipment was also destroyed, you do not regain it.</li>
</ul>

When your goal is complete, you finally find rest. You die and cannot be restored to life.

<h3>Undead Form</h3>

Your Constitution score increases by 2 and your Wisdom score increases by 1. An ability score cannot be increased beyond 16 this way. In addition, your creature type changes to undead. Spells and abilities that state effects or conditions specifically regarding Undead of a specific CR have no effect on you. If you are reduced to 0 hit points and fall unconscious as a result, any healing you receive will stabilize you and leave you on 1 hit point and unconscious. Furthermore, you cannot die from old age and you do not require air, food or drink.

<h3>Crumbling Lifeforce</h3>

Your grasp on the world is tenuous at best, and your soul longs to leave this world and travel to the world of the dead.  You are not affected by restoration magic of any kind, and do not regain hit points when you take a short or long rest.

<h2>Transformation Level 2</h2>

At 2nd level, you can pick one of the following boons. In addition, you also gain the Hideous Appearance flaw.

<h3>Horrifying Visage</h3>

As an action, you can force each creature of your choice within 30 feet of and able to see you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Targets that fail the saving throw are frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if you are within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can use this boon a number of times equal to your transformation level. You regain all uses when you finish a long rest.

<h3>Restless</h3>

<br><br>You no longer require sleep, and can fill a long rest with light activity such as keeping watch.  In addition, you do not gain a level of exhaustion from lack of rest.

<h3>Vengeful Tracker</h3>

You know the distance and direction between you and any creature involved in your goal, even across planar borders, such as a person you seek vengeance against or someone you pledged to defend.

<h3>Hideous Appearance</h3>

Your appearance has greatly altered from its original features.  Your skin is pale and clammy, your eyes have a haunting appearance with a violent flare of determination constantly present, and you appear as if a corpse of yourself.  However, the following situations can reveal your true appearance:

<ul>
    <li>Concentrating on a spell</li>
    <li>Gaining the unconscious condition</li>
    <li>Entering hallowed ground</li>
    <li>Choosing to reveal your true self</li>
</ul>

In events of extreme emotional or physical stress, a GM may call for a Constitution saving throw with a DC of their choosing to see if you maintain your humanoid form.

<h2>Transformation Level 3</h2>

At 3rd level, you can pick one of the following boons, or pick a boon from a lower level that you meet the prerequisites for. In addition, you also gain the  flaw.

<h3>Life Drain</h3>

Your touch disrupts the life force of other beings. As an action, you can choose a creature within 5 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 8d8 necrotic damage, and you gain half as many temporary hit points. If this damage causes the creature to drop to 0 hit points, the creature automatically dies and you regain an expended use of this boon.

You can use this boon a number of times equal to your Transformation level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h3>Unfaltering</h3>

<em>Prerequisite: Restless</em>

<br><br>If you spend 8 hours outside of combat, you gain the benefits of a long rest, regardless of your other actions.  If you enter combat at any point, you must spend 8 hours after the end of the combat in order to gain the benefits of a long rest.

<h3>Untethered Mind</h3>

Your mind starts to follow your body in its dissolution. Less significant memories of your existence before your revenant transformation, other than those related to your goal, start to fade like they're dreams you've awakened from. The GM can claim you can't recall something from your living past when it's dramatic or might disadvantage you. Also, you have disadvantage whenever you attempt an Intelligence check to recall information not related to your goal.

This lack of connection to your previous self can cause personality changes. You might forget old grudges or traumas, which can change your personality traits or alignment for the better. It's more likely that you cling to any vestige of your old self, amplifying their importance, nursing resentments and gloomy thoughts. You might come to hate those who have a normal existence, taking a turn toward evil.

<h2>Transformation Level 4</h2>

At 4th level, you can pick one of the following boons, or pick a boon from a lower level that you meet the prerequisites for. In addition, you also gain the Hyperfocused flaw.

<h3>Regenerate</h3>

You regain 10 hit points at the start of your turn if you have at least 1 hit point remaining.

If you take fire or radiant damage, or damage from holy water, this ability does not function at the start of your next turn.

<h3>Vengeful Glare</h3>

<em>Prerequisite: Vengeful Tracker</em>

<br><br>Once per long rest, you can attempt to enact your vengeance on a target related to your goal.  You can use an action to force a creature that can see you within 60 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw.

<br><br>On a failed saving throw, the target is paralyzed until you deal damage to it, or until the end of your next turn.  When the paralysis ends, the target is also frightened of you for 1 minute.  The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if it can see you, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success.

<h3>Hyperfocused</h3>

You only care to complete your goal, and have no time for anything else.  You have disadvantage on any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw you make that does not directly benefit you in your pursuit of your goal.
