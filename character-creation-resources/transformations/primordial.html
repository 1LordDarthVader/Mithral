<h1>Primordial</h1>

There are several ways for a mortal to consume a primordial spark, but continuing to become an elemental takes concentrated effort.

Once acquired, one must spend a great deal of time contemplating and understanding the spark to unlock its full potential.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<strong>Ability Scores:</strong> Constitution 13
<br><br><strong>Roleplay:</strong> Either through ritual, defeating a greater elemental being, or some other means, you must consume a Primordial Spark
<br><br><strong>Transformation Save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

<h2>Milestones</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Defeat and absorb the power of a greater elemental</li>
    <li>Claim an elemental node</li>
    <li>Make an alliance with a being from one of the elemental planes</li>

<h2>Transformation Level 1</h2>

At 1st level, you gain all of the following boons and flaws.

<h3>Elemental Form</h3>
Your Constitution increases by 2 and your Wisdom score increases by 1. An ability score cannot be increased beyond 16 this way.

<br><br>You become an Elemental in addition to any other creature types you are. Spells and abilities that affect Elementals of a specific CR do not affect you.

<h3>Primordial Affinity</h3>
While able to control all elements, your Primordial birth was sparked by one particular element: your Primordial Affinity. Your body is infused with malleable elemental energy. You must choose an element below and gain all the benefits of that element:

<br><br><strong>Air.</strong> You have resistance to lightning damage. In addition, you can channel the air currents around you to guide a ranged attack. Once on each of your turns, when you make a ranged weapon or ranged spell attack, you can make that attack with advanage. If you are in a location without an air current - such as underwater - this feature has no effect.
<br><br><strong>Earth.</strong> You have resistance to poison damage. In addition, whenever you gain temporary hit points, you gain that many plus your proficiency bonus instead.
<br><br><strong>Fire.</strong> You have resistance to fire damage. In addition, whenever you deal fire damage, you can add your Constitution modifier to the damage dealt.
<br><br><strong>Water.</strong> You have resistance to cold damage. In addition, whenever a creature regains hit points due to a spell or feature you control, you can imbue them with healing elemental energy. The creature regains additional 1d6 hit points. Only one creature who regains hit points from the spell or feature can benefit from this.

<h3>Planar Binding</h3>
Your body and soul are bound to a primordial plane of existence. You have disadvantage on death saving throws as the plane attempts to pull you back to it. If you would be killed, your soul is taken back to a plane of existence of the GM's choice. This plane is your new home, and you become an NPC under the GM's control. If you are on the primordial plane responsible for your transformation, this flaw has no effect.

<h2>Transformation Level 2</h2>

At 2nd level, you can pick one of the following boons. In addition, you also gain the Elemental Appearance flaw.

<h3>Dual Nature</h3>
You can choose to add a second elemental source from the Primordial Affinity Boon to add to your form. When you do so, you gain the associated benefits of your new element.

<h3>Elemental Surge</h3>
You can channel pure elemental energy into a concentrated bolt of an element of your choice. On your turn, as an action you can choose one of the below choices:

<br><br><strong>Lightning Strike.</strong> You can make a special ranged attack targeting a creature within 60 feet. You are proficient with this attack, which uses your Constitution modifier. On a hit, this attack deals 3d8 + your Constitution modifier lightning damage. You can then use a bonus action to target another creature with 30 feet of the first target with the same attack. Increase the damage by 1d8 for each transformation level above 2.
<br><br><strong>Earth Shard.</strong> You can force a creature within 30 feet to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to 3d6 + your Constitution modifier, or half as much on a successful save. Increase the damage by 1d6 for each transformation level above 2. You also gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt.
<br><br><strong>Flame Wave.</strong> Each creature in a 15-foot cone originating in your square must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures in the area take fire damage equal to 2d8 + your Constitution modifier. Increase the damage by 1d8 for each transformation level above 2.
<br><br><strong>Aquatic Rejuvenation.</strong> Choose a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature regains a number of hit points equal to 2d8 + your Constitution modifier. Increase the amount of hit points regained by 1d8 for each transformation level above 2.

<br><br>You can use these features a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, regaining all expended uses upon completing a long rest.

<h3>Call the Four</h3>
You can use your action to summon or repel elemental forces around you, causing one of the following effects of your choice:

<ul>
    <li>You create a 15-foot radius globe of breathable air around you. Creatures can pass freely in or out of the globe, but other elemental forces like water or fire cannot. Alternatively, you can choose to banish all air from inside the globe. This globe lasts for 10 minutes, and you must concentrate on it (as per concentrating to maintain a spell).</li>
    <li>You can conjure up to 50 pounds of loose earth at a point within 30 feet of you. Alternatively, you can shape the earth and stone within 15 feet of you. If affecting dirt or stone on the ground, you can cause it to become difficult terrain.</li>
    <li>All flammable objects not worn or wielded within 30 feet of you to burst into flame for 1 minute. Alternatively, all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you are immediately extinguished.</li>
    <li>You can conjure up to 10 gallons of water at a point within 30 feet of you or cause the water to fall like rain in a 30-foot area for 1 minute. Alternatively, you can choose to repel water within 15 feet of you. This ability has no effect on living creatures but repels mist, rain and creates pockets of air if submerged in water.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Elemental Appearance</h3>
Your appearance has grotesquely transformed. Your eyes might be smoldering embers, water could continuously pour from your mouth or nose, your extremities may crumble like sand, or patches of your skin might fade to transparency. Regardless of your true form, you are horrific to behold. You can suspend this form and manifest the appearance of the humanoid you once were, but this is taxing and requires concentration.

This form is not permanent, and moments of stress  are likely to reveal your true nature. Your true form is revealed in the following situations:

<ul>
    <li>Concentrating on a spell.</li>
    <li>Gaining the unconscious condition.</li>
    <li>Choosing to reveal yourself.</li>
    <li>In events of extreme emotional or physical stress, the GM may call for a Constitution saving throw with a DC of their choosing to see if you maintain your humanoid form.</li>
</ul>

Non-chaotic creatures that witness your true form become hostile to you, unless the GM decides otherwise.

<h2>Transformation Level 3</h2>

At 3rd level, you can pick one of the following boons, or pick a boon from a lower level that you meet the prerequisites for. In addition, you also gain the Force of Nature flaw.

<h3>Aura of Awakening</h3>
You emit an aura of power that awakens the elemental forces in your companions. When you first gain this feature, choose one of the options below. You may change the aura you emit upon completing a long rest.

<br><br><strong>Light as Air.</strong> Whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you makes a Dexterity saving throw, the creature gains a bonus equal to your Constitution modifier. You must be conscious to grant this bonus.
<br><br><strong>Forged in Fire.</strong> While you are conscious, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you deals damage with a melee weapon attack, they deal additional fire damage equal to your Constitution modifier. You must be conscious to grant this bonus.
<br><br><strong>Heart of Stone.</strong> At the beginning of your turn, you and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. While a creature has temporary hit points gained in this manner and are not incapacitated, they cannot be moved or knocked prone, unless they choose to be. You must be conscious to grant this bonus.
<br><br><strong>Spring of Life.</strong> Each unconscious, non-sleeping creature of your choice within 10 feet of you regains 1 hit point at the beginning of their turn. You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

<h3>Master of Many</h3>
<em>Prerequisite: Dual Nature</em>

<br><br>You can choose to add a third elemental source to your form. When you do so, you gain the associated benefits of your new element from Primordial Affinity in addition to your current source benefits.

<h3>Primeval Body</h3>
Your transformation to an elemental form has changed your body entirely. You no longer need to sleep, breathe, or eat. You also gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

<h3>Force of Nature</h3>
You are losing your connection to societal norms. The needs of civilization, community, and morals pale in comparison to the elemental chaos roiling within you. Whenever you complete a long rest, if you are within civilization, you do not regain any hit dice or lose any levels of exhaustion. In these circumstances, the GM decides if a location is considered civilized or not. Alternatively, the GM can decide that a park or grove within a city is sufficient.

<h2>Transformation Level 4</h2>

At 4th level, you can pick one of the following boons, or pick a boon from a lower level that you meet the prerequisites for. In addition, you also gain the Pull of Chaos flaw.

<h3>Elemental Mastery</h3>
<em>Prerequisite: Master of Many</em>

<br><br>You gain the fourth elemental source to your form. When you do so, you gain the associated benefits of your new element from Primordial Affinity.

<br><br>Additionally, you can summon the four elements to wreath you in power. Whenever a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 damage of a type of your choice from cold, fire, lightning or bludgeoning, or half as much on a successful save. Until the end of your following turn, your Primordial Affinity feature has one of the following additions:

<br><br><strong>Air.</strong> You have advantage on all ranged weapon and ranged spell attacks instead of only one.
<br><br><strong>Earth.</strong> At the beginning of your turn you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your character level.
<br><br><strong>Fire.</strong> At the beginning of your turn, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of you takes 2d6 fire damage.
<br><br><strong>Water.</strong> Whenever a creature regains hit points due to a spell or feature you control that creature regains an additional number of hit points equal to your character level.

<br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, regaining all uses upon completing a long rest.

<h3>Energy Flow</h3>
As a bonus action, you can burst into a shower of elemental material then materialize somewhere else. You magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying. Moving in this way does not provoke opportunity attacks. After teleporting, you can choose one of the following:

<br><br><strong>Swift Assault.</strong> You can immediately make a weapon attack. If you make a ranged attack, you do not have disadvantage if a hostile creature is within 5 feet.
<br><br><strong>Spark Storm.</strong> Each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save creatures take 2d6 fire damage.
<br><br><strong>Boulderous Hide.</strong> Choose a damage type. Until the start of your next turn, you have resistance to that damage type.
<br><br><strong>Sea Mother's Tether.</strong> A thin tether of water links you to a creature within 30 feet for 1 minute. While tethered, if the creature would take damage, you can choose to take that damage instead. Additionally, if you would be damaged, the tethered creature can choose to take that damage instead. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any way.

<br><br>You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier. You regain all expended uses at the end of a long rest.

<h3>Potent Aura</h3>
<em>Prerequisite: Aura of Awakening</em>

<br><br>Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you gain resistance to lightning, fire, poison, and cold damage.

<h3>Pull of Chaos</h3>
Your new native plane attempts to pull you to it, laying claim to your form. Whenever you roll a natural 1 on a saving throw against a magical spell or ability, you take 1d6 force damage per two character levels in addition to any other damage or effects you would suffer, as your native plane attempts to unbind you from the Material Plane. For example, a 6th-level character would take 3d6 force damage. This damage ignores resistances and immunities.
