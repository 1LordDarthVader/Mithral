        <h1>Volcanic Focus</h1>
        Harbingers of the volcanic focus draw upon fiery, volcanic magic. This magic is among the most uncontrollable of the harbinger foci, and unless a harbinger is careful they can easily destroy themselves.<br><br>
Focus Spells<br />
At 1st level, you learn the Create Bonfire cantrip. At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 17th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Volcanic Focus Spells table.<br><br>
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the harbinger spell list, the spell is nonetheless a harbinger spell for you.

<h2>Volcanic Core</h2>
Starting at 1st level, the heat of a volcano's core radiates within you. The area within 10 ft surrounding you is increased in temperature. Creatures within this range must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d10 fire damage and become unable to take Dash or Disengage actions due to heatstroke. A creature acclimated to a hot environment makes this saving throw at advantage. You can suppress this aura as a bonus action, lasting until you use a bonus action to reactivate it.<br><br>
In addition, you gain resistance to fire damage.
<h2>Obsidian Shell</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your skin or outermost layer of armor or clothing (if applicable) becomes covered in a layer of obsidian. Any creature who hits you with a melee attack causes obsidian to splinter off, which deals slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier to the attacker.
<h2>Thermal Furnace</h2>
Starting at 10th level, your volcanic core heats up as if an entire magma chamber resided inside you. Creatures that fail the saving throw against your Volcanic Core feature now take 2d10 fire damage, and half as much damage on a successful saving throw.<br><br>
In addition, small metal objects within your aura are heated up to be uncomfortable, though not harmful, to touch. Creatures within your aura holding metal weapons make attack rolls with these weapons at disadvantage.
<h2>Pyroclastic Surge</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you learn how to channel the most deadly part of a volcanic eruption - pyroclastic surges.<br><br>
As an action, you can create a surge of super-heated gases and ash that moves forward in a 60 ft cone at rapid speed. Creatures in the surge must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 4d10 fire damage, 3d10 poison damage, and becoming blinded on a failed saving throw. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded. The lesser restoration spell or similar magic can end the blinded condition on a creature.<br><br>
You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
