        <h1>Revelatory Beast Focus</h1>
        Including great dragons, krakens, or even the mighty tarrasque, great beasts are commonly associated with the end of the world. Harbingers that draw power from these immense creatures are of this focus. They can inspire fear and horror in their enemies, and then crush them with brute force.
<h2>Focus Spells</h2>
At 1st level, you learn the Primal Savagery cantrip. At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 17th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Revelatory Beast Focus Spells table.<br><br>
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the harbinger spell list, the spell is nonetheless a harbinger spell for you.

In addition, you gain proficiency with martial weapons, medium armor, and shields.
<h2>Primal Hunter</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you can hunt and fight like a beast. You can cast the hunter's mark spell as a 1st-level spell without needing concentration and without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once) and regain all expended uses on a long rest.
<h2>Extra Attack</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
<h2>Brutality</h2>
Starting at 10th level, your attacks are brutal and hit hard. Your melee weapon attacks deal an additional die of damage on a critical hit.<br><br>
In addition, your weapon attacks are now considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical damage.
<h2>Petrifying Fear</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can exude the primal fear that apocalyptic beasts inspire in mortals. As an action, you can force creatures of your choice within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. Creatures that fail are frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature that is frightened of you in this way is also considered paralyzed. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds its saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once) and regain all expended uses on a long rest.
