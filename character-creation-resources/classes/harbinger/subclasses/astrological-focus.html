        <h1>Astrological Focus</h1>
        The cosmos inspire wonders in humanity, but also terror. Any number of cosmic horrors and astronomical anomalies prowl the cosmos, things that could destroy humanity in an instant if they so desired. Some harbingers, instead of avoiding this topic, choose to study it instead and learn the mysteries that we were never meant to solve.
<h2>Focus Spells</h2>
At 1st level, you learn the Eldritch Blast cantrip. At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 17th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Astrological Focus Spells table.<br><br>
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the harbinger spell list, the spell is nonetheless a harbinger spell for you.

<h2>Nebulous Aura</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you exude an aura that appears as a nebula to outside viewers. The area within 10 feet of you is considered lightly obscured to creatures of your choice and is immune to divination spells cast by hostile creatures.<br><br>
In addition, you gain resistance to psychic damage.
<h2>Infinite Abyss</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you have seen so many horrible things that nothing sparks fear. You are immune to the frightened condition.<br><br>
In addition, as an action you can share what you have seen with a creature within 5 feet. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you until the start of your next turn. A creature that succeeds its saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
<h2>Great Nebula</h2>
Starting at 10th level, your nebulous aura grows in magnitude. Its range increases to 30 feet.<br><br>
In addition, allies within your nebula may use a bonus action to take the Disengage or Hide action.
<h2>Supernova</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can unleash a burst of searing light. As an action, you can force creatures of your choice within 60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. Creatures that fail their saving throw take 8d6 radiant damage and are blinded for 1 minute. Creatures that succeed take half as much damage and aren't blinded. An blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><br>
You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so on a long rest.
