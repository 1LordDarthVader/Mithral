        <h1>Temporal Focus</h1>
        While most harbinger foci entail active causes of the apocalypse, harbingers of the temporal focus study time. The relentless march of time can reduce even the grandest of cities to rubble eventually, and these harbingers are willing to sit back and wait.<br><br>
Focus Spells<br />
At 1st level, you learn the Toll the Dead cantrip. At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 17th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Temporal Focus Spells table.<br><br>
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the harbinger spell list, the spell is nonetheless a harbinger spell for you.

<h2>Temporal Awareness</h2>
Starting at 1st level, your study of time grants you insight into historical events. You gain proficiency in the History skill if you don't already have it and your proficiency bonus is doubled for checks made with it.<br><br>
In addition, you always know the time of day down to the second and can perfectly recall anything you have seen or heard within the past 5 days.
<h2>Ruinous Aura</h2>
Also starting at 1st level, you radiate an aura within which objects age much faster. Creatures wearing armor of your choice who come within 15 feet of you suffer a penalty to their Armor Class equal to half of your Wisdom modifier, rounding down, as their armor corrodes and rusts away.<br><br>
The damage caused to armor by this feature can be repaired over the course of a long rest.
<h2>Rapid Spellcaster</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can spring into combat and cast spells at a moment's notice. You may add your Wisdom modifier to your initiative rolls.<br><br>
In addition, during the first round of combat, you may cast any cantrip with a casting time of 1 action as a bonus action.
<h2>Psychometrist</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can understand the history of objects. As an action, you can touch an object and learn everything that happened to it within the last five days.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once) and regain all expended uses on a long rest.
<h2>Temporal Glimpse</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can peer into the future to gain insight into your plans. As a bonus action, you can grant yourself or an ally within 15 feet advantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of your next turn.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once) and regain all expended uses on a long rest.
