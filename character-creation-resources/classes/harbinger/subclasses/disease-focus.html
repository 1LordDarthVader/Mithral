        <h1>Disease Focus</h1>
        Among all harbingers, those of the disease focus are the most mysterious and unpersonable. Their magic is by far the most devastating, able to easily wipe out entire cities or even nations, even if it wouldn't seem as so at first glance.
<h2>Focus Spells</h2>
At 1st level, you learn the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=118">Chill Touch</a> cantrip. At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 17th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Disease Focus Spells table.<br><br>
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the harbinger spell list, the spell is nonetheless a harbinger spell for you.

<h2>Spread the Plague</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you become a vector for spreading death, disease, and decay. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC at the start of each of their turns or take necrotic damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 damage).<br><br>
This affect occurs every turn the creature is within your aura until it leaves or passes the saving throw twice in a row. This feature does not affect constructs or undead.<br><br>
In addition, you gain resistance to necrotic damage and immunity to disease.
<h2>Incurable Strain</h2>
Starting at 6th level, when you deal necrotic damage, the damage cannot be healed by magical or natural means short of the wish spell until the affected creature finishes a long rest.
<h2>Become the Plague</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you become significantly more virulent for spreading death, disease and decay. The range of your Spread the Plague feature increases to 15 feet and the feature now deals damage equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.<br><br>
In addition, a creature must succeed on its saving throw against your Spread the Plague feature four times in a row before it becomes immune.
<h2>Avatar of Death</h2>
Starting at 14th level, You become a master of death itself and can drain the life out of your enemies. All creatures of your choice within 35 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures that fail their saving throw take 8d6 necrotic damage and lose a number of hit dice equal to your Wisdom modifier. A creature that succeeds its saving throw takes half as much damage and suffers no additional effects. You heal by a number of hit points equal to half the damage rolled. This feature does not affect constructs or undead.<br><br>
You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
