        <h1>Meteoric Focus</h1>
        Among all methods of apocalypse, none are more iconic than a meteor. Quick, clean, and simple. Harbingers of this focus are a hearty bunch who love a good rumble. Their magic is brutal and hits hard.
<h2>Focus Spells</h2>
At 1st level, you learn the Magic Stone cantrip. At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 17th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Meteoric Focus Spells table.<br><br>
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the harbinger spell list, the spell is nonetheless a harbinger spell for you.

In addition, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.
<h2>Meteoric Armor</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to cover your skin in hardened, stone-like armor. As a bonus action, you can gain armor for the next minute. While this feature is active, your Armor Class is 13 + your Constitution modifer and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. You gain no benefit from wearing armor while this feature is active, but you can use a shield as normal.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once) and regain all expended uses on a long rest.
<h2>Hammering Assault</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your attacks hammer at the speed of a meteor shower. When you cast a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.
<h2>Adamantine Meteor</h2>
Starting at 10th level, your meteoric armor is strong as adamantine, a mineral most commonly found in meteors. Any critical hit against you becomes a regular hit while your Meteoric Armor feature is active.<br><br>
In addition, your weapon attacks now deal double damage to objects and structures and are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical damage.
<h2>Shock Wave</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you learn to create the shock waves produced by meteorlogical impacts. As a reaction after taking damage, you can create a massive shock wave. The shock wave expands out from you in a circle to a distance of 30 feet forcing all creatures within range to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. Creatures that fail their saving throw take 3d10 thunder damage and are pushed 15 feet away from you and knocked prone. Creatures that succeed their saving throw take half as much damage and don't suffer any additional effects. Unsecured objects are thrown by the shock wave 15 feet past the end of the wave's range. The shock wave is heard up to 1 mile away.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once) and regain all expended uses on a long rest.
