        <h1>Storm Focus</h1>
        Storms of the sky and sea are part of the oldest legends of the apocalypse. These harbingers can take on the power of these legends, using water, wind, and lightning to destroy their foes.
<h2>Focus Spells</h2>
At 1st level, you learn the Windborne Weapon cantrip. At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 17th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Storm Focus Spells table.<br><br>
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the harbinger spell list, the spell is nonetheless a harbinger spell for you.

<h2>Thunderbolts</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to throw lightning like javelins. As a free action on your turn, you can call down a bolt of lightning to use as a weapon. A bolt is a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient, and you may use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier for attacks made with it. It has the thrown (60/120) property and deals 1d10 lightning damage on a hit. The target hit cannot take reactions until the start of your next turn. The damage dealt by this feature increases to 2d10 at 11th level.<br><br>
In addition, you gain resistance to lightning damage.
<h2>Lightning Arc</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your lightning can arc to nearby targets. When you hit a creature with a lightning bolt from your Thunderbolts feature, you can choose a target within 10 feet of the original target. This second target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take lightning damage of one die size smaller than the initial bolt (d8 to d6, d10 to d8, etc). The target makes this saving throw at disadvantage if they are wearing armor made of metal.<br><br>
You can arc the lightning to additional creatures within 10 feet of the second target if the second target fails its saving throw. These creatures make the same saving throw or take lightning damage of decreasing damage each time. Once the arc deals d4s of lightning damage, it cannot arc again.<br><br>
You can cause the lightning to arc any number of times after the first a total amount of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1), and regain all expended uses on a long rest.
<h2>Sonic Boom</h2>
Starting at 10th level, your bolts of lightning are infused with thunderous energy. When they hit a target, they unleash a thunderous boom that can be heard for up to 1 mile away. Creatures within 15 feet of the target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be deafened for 1 minute.<br><br>
An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><br>
In addition, your lightning bolts now deal an additional 1d10 thunder damage. This damage does not carry over through your Lightning Arc feature.
<h2>Wrathful Storm</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can unleash far more lightning bolts. When you use your action to make an attack with a lightning bolt from your Thunderbolts feature, you can make two attacks as part of the same action. You can call a lightning bolt to use as a weapon as a part of the same attack you use to attack with one.<br><br>
In addition, you gain infinite uses of your Lightning Arc feature.
