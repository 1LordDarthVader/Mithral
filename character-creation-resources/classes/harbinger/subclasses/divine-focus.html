        <h1>Divine Focus</h1>
        Sometimes the gods wipe the world clean, using their divine power to destroy so that a new civilization can rise. Harbingers of this focus serve as arms of the gods' will in this regard. They can tap into powerful divine magic, something unique to their focus.
<h2>Focus Spells</h2>
At 1st level, you learn the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=642">Sacred Flame</a> cantrip. At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 17th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Divine Focus Spells table.<br><br>
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the harbinger spell list, the spell is nonetheless a harbinger spell for you.

<h2>Radiant Infusion</h2>
Starting at 1st level, your spells burn with radiant light. Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage, you can choose to replace its damage type with radiant.<br><br>
In addition, you gain resistance to radiant damage.
<h2>Radiant Aura</h2>
Also starting at 1st level, you radiate an aura of holy light. You radiate bright light out to 10 feet and dim light 10 feet beyond that. As a bonus action, you can suppress this light until you use a bonus action to radiate it again.
<h2>Divine Blast</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your spells are increased in potency. You may add your Wisdom modifier to one damage roll of your cantrips.
<h2>Burning Light</h2>
Starting at 10th level, your light is increased in intensity and becomes harmful to those that hide from the light. It is considered sunlight, and fiends and undead within your bright light suffer disadvantage on attack rolls.
<h2>Angelic Paragon</h2>
Starting at 14th level, the divine magic within you bursts out. You sprout ethereal, incorporeal feathered wings which grant you a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
