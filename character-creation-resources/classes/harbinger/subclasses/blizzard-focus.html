        <h1>Blizzard Focus</h1>
        Blizzard harbingers control the chilled magics of snow and ice. Their magic can freeze their enemies solid. Blizzard harbingers are cold, calculating, and very unpersonable.
<h2>Focus Spells</h2>
At 1st level, you learn the Frostbite cantrip. At 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 17th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Blizzard Focus Spells table.<br><br>
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the harbinger spell list, the spell is nonetheless a harbinger spell for you.

<h2>Arctic Wind</h2>
Starting at 1st level, as an action, you can blast a wind of sheer cold from your position. The wind fills an area 5 feet wide and 30 feet long, or a 15 foot sphere, originating from you and moving with you. Creatures within the wind have disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution ability checks, as well as on saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell.<br><br>
The wind lasts 1 hour or until you use a bonus action to end it. You can change the direction it blows if it is a line or between a line and a sphere as a bonus action on your turn. You are immune to the effects of the wind. You can designate a number of creatures less than or equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature) to also be immune to the effects of the wind.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once) and regain all expended uses on a long rest.<br><br>
In addition, you gain resistance to cold damage.
<h2>Arctic Gale</h2>
Starting at 6th level, the speed of the ice-cold wind you can summon increases significantly. Ranged attacks that target a point within or pass through your wind are made at disadvantage.
<h2>Arctic Storm</h2>
Starting at 10th level, the arctic winds you can summon drop in temperature and increase in velocity. Creatures that move into the wind for the first time or start their turn there must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d8 cold damage. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage. A creature acclimated to a cold environment makes this saving throw at advantage. Creature exempted from your Arctic Wind feature are also immune to this feature.<br><br>
In addition, the wind's range increases to 15 feet wide and 60 feet long or a 30 foot sphere.
<h2>Ice Age</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can plunge the nearby area into an ice age. You may now use your Arctic Wind feature an unlimited number of times.<br><br>
In addition, the damage of your Arctic Storm feature increases to 2d8 cold damage and creatures not acclimated to a cold environment make the saving throw against your Arctic Storm feature at disadvantage.
