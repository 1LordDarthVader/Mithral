<h1>Harbinger</h1>
Harbingers serve to remind everyone that while nature may be beautiful at times, one should never forget the sheer destructive power of its wrath and the devastation of its unbridled fury. Wielding powerful magic, harbingers manipulate these forces to annihilate their foes.

<h2>Class Features</h2>
As a harbinger, you gain the following class features
<h3>Hit Points</h3>
<strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per harbinger level<br/>
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br/>
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per harbinger level after 1st
<h3>Proficiencies</h3>
<strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor<br/>
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons<br/>
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Wisdom<br/>
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival.
<h3>Equipment</h3>
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
<ul>
    <li>(a) a shortbow and 20 arrows or (b) two simple melee weapons</li>
    <li>traveler's clothes and an equipment pack</li>
    <li>leather armor and a druidic focus</li>
</ul>
<h3>Apocalyptic Speech</h3>
Starting at 1st level, you can speak, read, and write Apocalyptic, the secret language of harbingers. Ancient prophecies of the end of the world are commonly written in this language, as are many omens.
<br><br>
The language can be recognized as such with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check, but can't be understood by a non-harbinger without magic.
<h3>Entropic Focus</h3>
Starting at 1st level, you choose the focus with which to center your destructive magic around. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.
<h3>Spellcasting</h3>
Drawing on the power of nature's wrath, you can cast spells that bend this primal force to your bidding.
<h4>Cantrips</h4>
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the harbinger spell list. You learn additional harbinger cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Harbinger table.
<h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
The Harbinger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your harbinger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these harbinger spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
<br><br>
You prepare the list of harbinger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the harbinger spell list. When you do so, choose a number of harbinger spells equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your harbinger level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
<br><br>
You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of harbinger spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
Intelligence or Wisdom (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for your harbinger spells, since your magic draws from primal forces.
<br><br>
<strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier<br>
<strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier
<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your harbinger spells.
<h3>Entropic Extraction</h3>
Starting at 2nd level, you can draw power from the entropy of your enemies' deaths. When you damage a creature of CR 1/2 or higher, you place an entropic hex upon it. When a creature with one of your entropic hexes dies, you gain an entropy point. You can have a maximum amount of entropy points equal to your harbinger level.
<br><br>
You can also expend a hit die and roll it as a bonus action, gaining entropy points equal to the number rolled.
<br><br>
Your current number of entropy points is halved when you complete a short rest, rounding down, and is reset to 0 when you finish a long rest.
<h3>Entropic Empowering</h3>
Starting at 2nd level, you can expend entropy points to gain various benefits. You learn two Entropic Empowering options at 2nd level and one additional option at 6th and 12th levels.
<br><br>
If an option allows you to apply a modifier to a d20 roll, you do so after the roll but before you know the outcome.
<h4>Entropic Amplification</h4>
You can expend entropy points to expand the area of effect of your magic. When you cast a spell that affects an area, you can expend entropy points to increase the area of the effect of the spell by 5 feet for every 2 entropy points expended.
<h4>Entropic Befuddlement</h4>
You can expend entropy points to interrupt your enemies' efforts to concentrate. When a creature you can see makes a saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can use your reaction to expend entropy points and impose a penalty to the saving throw equal to the number of entropy points expended.
<h4>Entropic Derangement</h4>
You can expend entropy points to distract your enemies' minds. When you impose an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can expend entropy points and impose a penalty to the saving throw of a single target equal to the number of entropy points expended.
<h4>Entropic Destruction</h4>
You can expend entropy points to increase the damage of your attacks. When you deal damage, you can expend entropy points and gain a bonus to the damage equal to the number of entropy points expended. This extra damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any way.
<h4>Entropic Guidance</h4>
You can expend entropy points to guide your strikes to hit true. When you make a weapon attack, you can expend entropy points and gain a bonus to the attack roll equal to the number of entropy points expended.
<h4>Entropic Withering</h4>
You can expend entropy points to wither your enemies' martial abilities. When you impose a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you can expend entropy points and impose a penalty to the saving throw of a single target equal to the number of entropy points expended.
<h3>Entropic Recovery</h3>
Also starting at 2nd level, you can expend your own vitality to empower your magical abilities. When you complete a short rest, you can expend a number of hit dice up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).
<br><br>
Roll a number of d4s equal to the number of hit dice expended. You regain expended spell slots with a combined level equal to half the total rolled, though none of the restored spell slots can be above 5th level.
<br><br>
You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
<h3>Cantrip Versatility</h3>
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the harbinger spell list.
<h3>Inevitable</h3>
Starting at 18th level, your magic will surely crush your foes. Any spells or effects granted by your entropic focus ignore resistance to damage.
<h3>Apocalypse</h3>
Starting at 20th level, you are so infused with destructive magic that your own magic fails to leave a scratch. You have immunity to the damage dealt by your own spells and you automatically succeed on saving throws against your own spells.
<br><br>
In addition, at the start of each of your turns, if you have no entropy points remaining, you gain 5 entropy points, and your maximum number of entropy points is increased to 30.
