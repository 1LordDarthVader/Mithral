<h1>Mentor</h1>
Few heroes achieve prominence all on their own, and many great tales feature those mysterious figures who take it upon themselves to guide, aid, and advice a future generation of legends. By sharing their experience, supporting their allies or personally stepping up to face the threats that might otherwise cut another hero’s journey short, mentor figures play a crucial part in many epic tales. Their influence may persist even in death.

<h2>Class Features</h2>
As a mentor, you gain the following class features
<h3>Hit Points</h3>
<strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per Mentor level<br/>
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br/>
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier
<h3>Proficiencies</h3>
<strong>Armor:</strong> All armor, shields<br/>
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons, improvised weapons<br/>
<strong>Tools:</strong> Choose one set of tools<br/>
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Intelligence, Wisdom<br/>
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose any three
<h3>Equipment</h3>
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
<ul>
    <li>(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons.</li>
    <li>(a) chain mail or (b) leather armor</li>
    <li>One set of tools that you are proficient in and an equipment pack</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bided Time</h3>
Starting at 1st level, when you spend your turn in Initiative not dealing damage, add a Bided Time die (a d4) to your Bided Time pool. The number of Bided Time dice added to your pool on such a turn increases to two at 4th level, three at 8th level and four at 12th level.
<br><br>
The pool can contain a max number of dice equal to your Mentor level. When you deal damage you may expend any number of dice from the pool and add those to the damage rolled against one creature or object.
<br><br>
You may also fill your Bided Time pool completely during a long or short rest by performing mentoring acts such as teaching, counseling or sparring with a willing creature. Half the dice in your Bided Time pool (rounded down) disappear when you roll for Initiative.
<h3>Strike Now!</h3>
Also starting at 1st level, as an action, you allow one creature within 60 feet of you to immediately make a singular weapon attack against a creature of your choice. A creature can only be granted this additional attack once per round of combat.
<br><br>
Starting when you hit 5th level, the target of your Strike Now feature can add 1d10 to their damage roll if the attack hits. This bonus damage increases to 2d10 once you reach 11th level.
<h3>Hidden Reserves</h3>
Starting at 2nd level you can spend a bonus action to restore one use of a creature’s ability or spell slot that otherwise restores on a short rest. They must be able to see or hear you.
<br><br>
Alternatively, if the creature has a pool that refills during a short rest, such as ki points, exploit dice or a 5th level bard’s inspiration dice, you may use Hidden Reserves to restore half that pool (rounded up).
<br><br>
Once used, you cannot use this ability again until you’ve completed a long rest. At 13th level, you may use this ability twice per long rest.
<h3>Time Heals</h3>
You instill the strength to push past injuries, and can soothe aches with a reassuring word or expert touch.
<br><br>
From 2nd level onwards, you may as a bonus action expend any number of dice from your Bided Time pool and heal one creature you can touch by the amount rolled.
<br><br>
You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Lesson modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h3>Mentor Archetype</h3>
At 3rd level you choose which archetype of mentor you will be. Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 10th and 14th level.

<ul>
<li><a href="./subclasses/eccentric-archetype.html">Eccentric Archetype</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/mystical-archetype.html">Mystical Archetype</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/protective-archetype.html">Protective Archetype</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/strict-archetype.html">Strict Archetype</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase 2 ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
<h3>Life Lessons</h3>
By 5th level, your experience allows you to teach friends and foes valuable life lessons.
<br><br>
Whenever you finish a long rest, select two options (for which you meet the prerequisites) from the following lessons. You are able to use those Lessons until you finish your next long rest.
Starting at 12th level, the number of Lessons you can select each day increases to three.
<h4>Lesson Ability</h4>
Your Lesson ability is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
<h3>Full Potential</h3>
Starting at 7th level you may, as an action, restore one use of a creature’s ability or spell slot that otherwise restores on a long rest. They must be able to see or hear you.
<br><br>
Once used, you cannot use this ability again until you’ve had a long rest.
<h3>Advanced Teachings</h3>
Upon reaching 9th level in this class, your attack rolls have advantage while your Bided Time pool is full.
<br><br>
When using your Strike Now! ability you may select one additional effect:
<ul>
    <li>The target can move up to half their movement speed before or after making the attack.</li>
    <li>You gain one Bided Time die.</li>
    <li>The target may cast a cantrip instead of making a weapon attack, but does not add the additional d10's from your Strike Now! feature to any damage rolled.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Forgotten Strength</h3>
At 11th level, choose one feature that another class or subclass could gain at 7th level or lower. Alternatively, choose a spell of level 4th or lower. You now have that feature, or the capacity to cast that spell once per long rest. This choice might reflect powers your Mentor had in their prime.
<br><br>
If the chosen ability forces creatures to make saving throws the DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Lesson modifier. Your spellcasting ability, if necessary, is your Lesson modifier's.
<br><br>
You do not count as having any levels in the feature's associated class, and the chosen feature can not be one that changes depending on the character's level. A few examples of off-limits choices would be ones like Action Surge, Rage, Wild Shape, Bardic Inspiration, Sneak Attack and any class's Spellcasting feature.
<h3>Montage</h3>
Starting at 15th level, you begin to spot potential improvements in people that can be accomplished via an extended period of training. With 1 week of practice, for which you must be present 8 hours every day, the target/targets of your montage may choose one of these benefits:
<ul>
    <li>Gain proficiency in a skill tied to their lowest ability score.</li>
    <li>Increase their daily number of prepared spells by 1.</li>
    <li>Boost their maximum hit points by 5.</li>
</ul>
If that week is extended to 1 month of training, the target/targets of your montage also gains one of these benefits:
<ul>
    <li>Learn one cantrip of their choice. Spellcasting ability is determined by which class’s spell list they choose the cantrip from.</li>
    <li>Gain either the Martial Adept, Crusher, Slasher or Piercer feat.</li>
    <li>Get proficiency in a saving throw tied to their lowest ability score.</li>
</ul>
Multiple creatures can be trained simultaneously, but your Montage's benefits can at no point in time be affecting a number of creatures greater than your Lesson modifier. The benefits of a Montage last until the creature undergoes a Montage again.
<h3>Nothing Left to Teach</h3>
At 17th level, a number of allies equal to your Lesson modifier add +2 to one ability score of their choice. This feature can push ability scores higher than 20.
<br><br>
The bonus fades if the allies spend more than 1 week separated from the Mentor, but if said Mentor leaves the narrative entirely the DM may deem it appropriate for the bonus to become permanent.
<h3>Renewed Strength</h3>
At 18th level, choose one feature that another class or subclass could gain at 15th level or lower. Alternatively, choose a spell of level 8th or lower. You now have that feature, or the capacity to cast that spell once per long rest.
<br><br>
If the chosen ability forces creatures to make saving throws the DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Lesson modifier. Your spellcasting ability if necessary is your Lesson modifier's.
<br><br>
You do not count as having any levels in the feature's associated class, and the chosen feature can not be one that changes depending on the character's level.
<h3>The Time has Come</h3>
Upon reaching 20th level, your Bided Time dice become d10s. You no longer lose any Bided Time dice from your pool when rolling Initiative.
