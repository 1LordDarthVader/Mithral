        <h1>Strict Archetype</h1>
        Tough love and demanding challenges are tools by which the Strict mentor tries to prepare their allies for a dangerous world. While they may sometimes come across as ornery or callous there is often a great deal of care behind their hardened exterior.
<h2>Criticism</h2>
Starting at 3rd level your ability to criticize an ally's missteps motivates them to succeed at future attempts.<br><br>
When a creature within 60ft of you fails a d20 roll where they added an ability modifier, you may use your reaction to critique them for it. Make note of which ability's modifier was added. That creature now has advantage on all d20 rolls it makes using the same ability as the previously failed roll.<br><br>
This effect ends once the creature has succeeded on such a roll, or when you use your Criticism feature again, whichever comes first.
<h2>We Rest When We're Dead</h2>
By 6th level you may, during a short or long rest, lead a number of willing creatures up to your Lesson modifier through grueling exercises that sharpen their talents and teamwork. Anyone undergoing this training can choose one of the following effects:
<ul>
<li>They may expend a number of their hit dice up to your Lesson modifier and gain temporary hit points equal to the amount rolled (they do not add their constitution modifier to the rolls). These temporary hit points persist until their next short or long rest unless otherwise depleted.</li>
<li>The creature may add your Lesson modifier to one attack roll made before their next short or long rest. They can do so after seeing the initial roll but before knowing whether the roll succeeded or failed.</li>
<li>They may use the Help action as a reaction once before their next short or long rest.</li>
</ul>
Creatures involved in the training still gain all other benefits of a rest.
<h2>Stoic Mind</h2>
At 10th level, whenever you make a Strength or Constitution based ability check, but before knowing whether the roll succeeded or failed, you may expend up to two dice from your Bided Time pool and increase your result by the amount rolled.
<h2>Like We Practiced</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to remind others of the hardships they've overcome so far, and grant them the strength to win when things seem most dire.<br><br>
As an action you may call out a battle formation. For the next minute, creatures within 60 feet of you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>+1 to AC for every allied creature within 5ft of them (to a max of +5).</li>
<li>+1 to damage rolls for every allied creature within 5ft of them (to a max of +5).</li>
<li>+1 to Dexterity saves for every allied creature within 5ft of them (to a max of +5)</li>
</ul>
Once used, you may not use this ability again until after completing a long rest.
