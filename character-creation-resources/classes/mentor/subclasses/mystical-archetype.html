        <h1>Mystical Archetype</h1>
        Certain people carry an arsenal of abilities so varied and fantastical that one constantly wonders what they might do next. Whether they're a powerful wizard or a whimsical nanny, Mystical mentors teach others to expect surprises around every corner.

<h2>Spellcasting</h2>
        <a class="breadcrumb" href="../../spells/classes/arcane.html">Arcane Spell List</a><br><br>
When you reach 3rd level, you further your air of supernatural mystery with the ability to cast spells.
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
You learn three cantrips of your choice from the arcane spell list. You learn another arcane cantrip of your choice at 10th level.
<h3>Spell Slots</h3>
The Mystical Mentor Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
<h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
You know three 1st-level arcane spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration or conjuration spells on the arcane spell list.<br><br>
The Spells Known column of the Mystical Mentor Spellcasting table shows when you learn more arcane spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the arcane spells you know with another spell of your choice from the arcane spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
You use your Lesson modifier's ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
<strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Lesson modifier<br />
<strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Lesson modifier
<h2>Magical All Along</h2>
By 6th level you may, during a long or short rest, lend some of your magic to a willing creature with an Intelligence of 6 or higher. Choose one 1st level spell from the arcane spell list that does not have the ritual tag. That creature may cast this spell once without expending a spell slot. Their spellcasting ability modifier for this spell is your Lesson modifier, and the DC of the spell equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Lesson modifier.<br><br>
The creature's ability to cast the spell fades if you use this feature again.
<h2>Sage Mind</h2>
At 10th level, whenever you make an Intelligence based ability check, but before you know whether the roll succeeded or failed, you may expend up to two dice from your Bided Time pool and increase your result by the amount rolled.
<h2>Conjurer of Cheap Tricks</h2>
By 14th level you may, once per long rest, cast a 5th level spell from the arcane spell list without expending a spell slot.
