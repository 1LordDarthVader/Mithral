        <h1>Eccentric Archetype</h1>
        Their methods are often inscrutable, but they have much wisdom to impart. Eccentric mentors tend to be affable or unimposing figures who forge wholesome bonds with their allies and only show their true capabilities when things are most dire.
<h2>Humbling Experience</h2>
Starting at 3rd level you may, when failing an ability check, gain a bonus equal to your Lesson modifier, potentially turning the failure into a success. If the roll in question was a contested ability check you may choose to instead gain a bonus equal to your opponent's challenge rating or level. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Lesson modifier, and regain all expended uses on a short rest.
<h2>Wax On, Wax Off</h2>
By 6th level, during a long or short rest, you may spend time with an ally that involves acts like telling them a story, teaching them about a tool you're proficient in or having them help you with chores.<br><br>
Grant that ally one of the following benefits that persists until your next long or short rest:
<ul>
<li>They have resistance to psychic or necrotic damage and immunity to either the frightened or charmed condition.</li>
<li>Their weapon attacks deal an additional 1d4 psychic damage. By imparting techniques that confound, outwit or demoralize opponents, you show that true battles are won in the mind.</li>
<li>Any time before your next long or short rest they may ask you a single &quot;yes or no&quot;-question, and you have a hunch about the correct answer. This functions as though you were the deity being beseeched by a Commune spell.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Puzzling Mind</h2>
By 10th level, insight checks against you are made at disadvantage. Whenever you make a Charisma based ability check, but before you know whether the roll succeeded or failed, you may expend up to two dice from your Bided Time pool and increase your result by the amount rolled.
<h2>Underestimated</h2>
Starting at 14th level, when forced to make a saving throw by another creature, you may choose to instead engage them in a contested ability check.<br><br>
You and the creature both make checks using the ability you would otherwise have used for the saving throw. If you win the contest you count as having succeeded on the saving throw, otherwise you count as having failed. If you beat your opponent's result by 10 or more you also impose the effect of a failure back on them.<br><br>
If the effect requires concentration to maintain, you can choose to be concentrating on it. Future saves against the effect have a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Lesson modifier.<br><br>
You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
