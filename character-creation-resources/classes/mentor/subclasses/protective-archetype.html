        <h1>Protective Archetype</h1>
        A lifespan is limited, but the bonds forged during it are eternal. A Protective mentor dedicates themselves wholly to the promise they see in their companions, and strives to further the party's journey at all costs. Even when it means risking their own life.
<h2>Shield of the Passing Torch</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, when a creature within your movement speed range becomes targeted by an attack or unwanted spell, you can use a reaction to move adjacent to them and become the target in their stead. You may choose whether to trigger opportunity attacks or not during this movement.<br><br>
Should the targeting effect leave you at 0 hit points, the shielded creature gains a bonus to their damage rolls equal to half your mentor level (rounded up). This bonus persists for 1 minute. Once this bonus has been granted, it cannot happen again until after you finish a long rest.
<h2>Just Another Path</h2>
By 6th level, during a long or short rest, you may spend time steeling your resolve to protect your allies. Choose one of the following benefits that persists until your next rest:
<ul>
<li>You gain resistance to one damage type from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing.</li>
<li>Your movement speed increases by 15 feet.</li>
<li>You remember or deduce two useful bits of information about the nearby area. This functions as the Commune with Nature spell.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Watchful Mind</h2>
At 10th level, the frightened condition can no longer inhibit your movement.<br><br>
Whenever you make a Wisdom based ability check, but before you know whether the roll succeeded or failed, you may expend up to two dice from your Bided Time pool and increase your result by the amount rolled.
<h2>Never Late</h2>
Starting at 14th level you may, as an action, designate a willing creature that you can touch. You can have a number of creatures up to your Lesson modifier designated at the same time, and if you use this ability on an additional creature after reaching that maximum you must select one of your previous targets to lose their designation.<br><br>
Whenever a creature designated by you drops below half their total hit points, you become aware of this fact and who it happened to. If you are asleep when becoming aware of it, you may choose to wake up.<br><br>
You can use your action to instantly appear within 15 feet of a creature that you've designated with this ability, provided that they are on the same plane of existence as you.<br><br>
Once used in this way, you may not use Never Late again until after after completing a long rest.
