<h1>Lessons</h1>

<h2 id="toc0"><span>Ace up The Sleeve</span></h2>
<p>You know one cantrip from the Wizard spell list. Starting at 11th level, this Lesson also lets you cast a 1st level spell from the Wizard spell list once without expending a spell slot. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is your Lesson modifier's.</p>
<p>This Lesson can be selected multiple times on the same day.</p>
<h2 id="toc1"><span>Dooooooodge!</span></h2>
<p>Your teachings prove effective enough to ward against danger with split-second advice. Whenever a creature within 60 feet of you is targeted by an attack, you may expend one Bided Time die from your pool and add the number rolled to the creature's AC against that attack. You must choose to use this ability before knowing the result of the attack roll.</p>
<h2 id="toc2"><span>Empty Your Cup</span></h2>
<p>You can spend one action helping a willing spellcaster clear their mind and remember the right spell from their arsenal. They may replace one spell they have prepared for another spell on their list of spells known. They must be able to see or hear you. Once used, you may not use this ability again until after a short rest.</p>
<h2 id="toc3"><span>Ex Position</span></h2>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 8th level</em></p>
<p>You have been many places, and thus know many things. By spending 10 minutes smoking or otherwise enjoying 250gp worth of incense you may bring to mind a brief summary of the significant lore about a person, place or object. This functions like the spell Legend Lore. Alternatively, you may cast the spell Find the Path.</p>
<p>Once used, you may not use this ability again until after a long rest.</p>
<h2 id="toc4"><span>Fly You Fools</span></h2>
<p>As an action, you may target a number of creatures up to your Lesson modifier who can see or hear you. For the next minute, each of those creatures get one additional action on their turns. This action may only be used to take the Dash action. You may also trigger this Lesson as part of your action when you initiate the I'll Hold Them Off Lesson.</p>
<p>Once used, you may not use this ability again until you have completed a long rest.</p>
<h2 id="toc5"><span>I Have the High Ground</span></h2>
<p>You punish the hubris of an enemy's reckless advance. You may use your reaction to enact this Lesson on another creature's turn. Until the end of their turn you manage to land counters whenever one of their melee attacks misses you, reducing the attacker's hit points by an amount equal to your Lesson modifier.</p>
<p>Once you reach 11th level in this class you can reduce the attackers hit points by an amount equal to twice your Lesson modifier for every missed attack.</p>
<p>You may also trigger this Lesson as part of your reaction when enacting the Protective Mentor ability Shield of the Passing Torch.</p>
<h2 id="toc6"><span>I'll Hold Them Off</span></h2>
<p>You may spend an action to remove yourself, and a number of enemy creatures whose combined CR sum equals no more than 1.5 times your Mentor level, from combat. You “hold off” the removed creatures long enough for your allies to finish the remainder of the encounter and/or escape.</p>
<p>Once your allies are out of Initiative (either by escaping or overcoming the remaining threats), roll a d20 that cannot be modified or rerolled.</p>
<p>On a 1-3 you die heroically. This death is permanent and cannot be reversed via resurrection spells, nor can the loss of the character be staved off by any other means, such as a Death Ward or Clone spell. Having protected your allies, your soul is at peace and does not return.</p>
<p>On a 4-19 you somehow managed a tense standstill or daring escape. Reduce your HP to half of what it was when you enacted this ability (minimum of 1). If your allies stayed to continue the fight, have everyone roll for Initiative again. If they escaped, you catch up to them.</p>
<p>On a 20, you killed all enemy creatures that were removed from combat. Put yourself at 1 HP. If your allies escaped, you catch up to them. Should the critical success occur, future 20’s can only result in a standstill for the next month.</p>
<h2 id="toc7"><span>If in Doubt, Follow Your Nose</span></h2>
<p>When a creature within 60 feet of you makes a Survival, Insight or Investigation check you may as a reaction expend up to two dice from your Bided Time pool and increase their result by the amount rolled. You may choose to use this ability after the roll but before knowing whether the check succeeded or failed.</p>
<h2 id="toc8"><span>If You Can Dodge a Wrench</span></h2>
<p>By repeatedly throwing objects at allies, you hone their reflexes. You may make non-damaging ranged weapon attack rolls against allied creatures. For each of these attacks that hit a creature, they gain a +1 bonus to their AC against ranged attacks until their next long rest.</p>
<p>This bonus applies only if the target doesn't intentionally improve their odds of being hit, but the Mentor may attempt to improve their odds of hitting by any means at their disposal.</p>
<p>You can make a total number of these attacks up to to your Lesson modifier. This Lesson can be selected multiple times on the same day.</p>
<h2 id="toc9"><span>Just Be Yourself</span></h2>
<p>You assure a creature that they are unique, wonderful and worthwhile.</p>
<p>When a creature within 60 feet of you makes a Persuasion, Performance or Animal Handling check you may as a reaction expend up to two dice from your Bided Time pool and increase their result by the amount rolled. You may choose to use this ability after the roll but before knowing whether the check succeeded or failed.</p>
<h2 id="toc10"><span>Legacy</span></h2>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 11th level, I'll Hold Them Off</em></p>
<p>You can choose to enact the I’ll Hold Them Off ability instead of making a death saving throw. This entails the Mentor willing themselves back to 1 hit point for the purpose of aiding their allies.</p>
<p>When you use the “I’ll Hold Them Off” ability you may increase the combined CR sum of creatures you are able to remove from combat. If you do this, the range of rolls that results in your death expands by a similar amount. For example, if you wish to Hold Off enemies with a CR sum that is 3 higher than you could normally Hold Off, you may do so. But you now die on a roll of 1-6 instead of 1-3.</p>
<p>Should you die when using your “I’ll Hold Them Off” ability, one of the following effects occur (DM’s choice):</p>
<ul>
<li>Your party members level up.</li>
<li>You kill, seal away or fundamentally defeat one creature of your choice among the enemies held off.</li>
<li>You return to life 24 hours later as a class of your choice other than the Mentor, whilst retaining your level. This is the only exception to the otherwise permanent character loss of I'll Hold Them Off.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc11"><span>Let me Shoulder it</span></h2>
<p>As an action, you embrace a willing creature other than yourself and try to help them work through difficult emotions. If they are experiencing Exhaustion, Maximum Hit point reduction, a curse or the Frightened condition, you may purge one of those effects from them at the risk of transferring it to yourself.</p>
<p>Make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you are now under the effects of the condition you removed from the creature. Once used, you may not use this ability again until you have finished a short rest.</p>
<h2 id="toc12"><span>Stay Alert</span></h2>
<p>When you or any creature within 30 feet of you rolls for Initiative, you may expend one Bided Time die from your pool and increase their Initiative by the amount rolled. If you wish to target multiple creatures with this ability a separate Bided Time die must be expended for each creature.</p>
<p>This occurs AFTER rolling for Initiative causes you to remove half the dice from your Bided Time pool.</p>
<h2 id="toc13"><span>Stop Trying to Hit Me and Hit Me</span></h2>
<p>You spar with an ally, and talk them into truly striking you. At the end of a short or long rest, one willing creature of your choice can make a weapon attack roll against you, dealing damage as normal upon a hit.</p>
<p>Make note of the damage you take. If this creature deals damage with the same weapon in the future they can choose to remember their training and increase the damage by the amount you wrote down, at which point this benefit fades.</p>
<p>This benefit also fades during your next long or short rest.</p>
<h2 id="toc14"><span>Who are YOU, and what do YOU want?</span></h2>
<p>As an action, you confront a creature that can hear you with difficult questions or harsh truths. If they are behaving in a way contrary to their moral judgment (for example because they are possessed, magically dominated, or coerced) you may for the next minute expend 1 die from your Bided Time pool any time they make an attack roll, ability check or saving throw and decrease the result by the amount rolled. The DM adjudicates if a creature qualifies as behaving against their moral judgment.</p>
<h2 id="toc15"><span>Why Do We Fall?</span></h2>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 8th level</em></p>
<p>A moment shared with you gives a creature the strength to carry on when they would otherwise stay down. You may cast the Death Ward spell once without expending a spell slot.</p>
