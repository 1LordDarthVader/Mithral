<h1>Demi-Dragon Race</h1>

<p>In order to take any levels in the Demi-Dragon class, you must choose the Demi-Dragon race.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Age.</strong> A demi-dragon can live for roughly four hundred years, starting from when they were first transformed.</p>
<p><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a Dragon.</p>
<p><strong>Size.</strong> Demi-dragons have a body mass that is identical to that of their previous form. At most, a demi-dragon stands 4 feet tall from shoulder to the ground, and measures no longer than 16 feet from snout to tail tip, of which their body accounts for a maximum of 5 feet. Your size is Medium.</p>
<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Aided Jump.</strong> Your wings provide you with lift. Your maximum jump distance for high and long jumps is doubled, and you do not need to take a running start. This extra distance costs movement as normal.</p>
<p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Scales.</strong> Your magical essence enhances your protective scales. While you aren't wearing armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Constitution modifier + your dragon spark ability score modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Mythic Build.</strong> You count as one size category larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>
<p>Your claws have enough manual dexterity to manipulate objects as normal, but you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with object weapons, and receive no benefit from wielding shields. In order to wear armor, you must have it specially constructed, costing three times the normal rate.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Weapons.</strong> You have access to an arsenal of natural weapons. These natural weapons count as martial melee weapons for you, and you are proficient with them. You can use them to make melee weapon attacks, and you add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your fanged maw deals 1d12 piercing damage on a hit.</li>
<li>Your lashing tail has a reach of 10 feet and deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage.</li>
<li>Your rending claws deal 1d6 slashing damage. When you take the Attack action and attack with your claw, you can use your bonus action to make an additional claw attack.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inheritance.</strong> Your connection to a particular type of true dragon manifests as a related skill. You gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, Acrobatics, Deception, History, and Persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.</p>
