<h1>Maneuvers</h1>

<h2>Bolstering Roar (1)</h2>
As a bonus action, you bolster the conviction of your companions. Each creature of your choice other than yourself that is within 20 feet of you and which can see or hear you gain a Bolster die, a d4. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bolster die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can only have one Bolster die at a time.

<h2>Hammering Lunge (1)</h2>
As a bonus action, make an attack with your horns against a target. You can choose to move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks before you make this attack.

<h2>Launch Ally (1)</h2>
As a bonus action, choose a friendly creature within 5 feet of you that is the same size category as you or smaller. That creature can use its reaction to let you launch it to an unoccupied space you can see within a number of feet of it equal to twice your Strength score.

<h2>Lockjaw (1)</h2>
As part of the Attack action, you can replace one attack you make with a special bite attack against a target. On a hit, the target must make a Strength saving throw if it's a creature that is up to one size category larger than you. On a failure, it is grappled.

<h2>Skylaunch (1)</h2>
As a bonus action, you spread your wings and launch 15 feet into the air. This maneuver doesn't expend your movement and doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Creatures up to one size category larger than you that are within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone by a powerful gust of wind as you launch. You remain airborne until the start of your next turn or until you are incapacitated.

<h2>Suppressing Gale (1)</h2>
As a bonus action, you blast gusts of wind at your surroundings. Creatures up to one size category larger than you within 30 feet of you must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 feet when moving closer to you. The gale disperses gas or vapor, and extinguishes candles, torches, and smaller unprotected flames in the area. This effect lasts until the start of your next turn, until you become incapacitated, or until you choose to end it early (no action required).

<h2>Thieving Talons (1)</h2>
As a bonus action, make an attack with your wings. On a hit, the must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop one item of your choice that it's holding. The object lands at its feet.

<h2>Brutal Dive (2)</h2>
As a bonus action that you can take while gliding or flying, you dive up to your Glide & Fly speed directly downwards. If you move at least 30 feet during your dive, choose one creature up to one size category larger than you that is within melee range. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone. As part of the same bonus action, you can then immediately make a bite attack against the creature.

<h2>Defiance (2)</h2>
As a bonus action, you steel yourself against all attackers. Until the start of your next turn, you gain resistance to all damage.

<h2>Fearsome Wound (2)</h2>
As a bonus action, make a claw attack against a target. On a hit, the target is wounded, causing it to bleed for an additional 1d6 damage at the end of its next turn. Additionally, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of its next turn.

<h2>Overbearing Sweep (2)</h2>
As a bonus action, make a claw attack against a target. On a hit, the target must make a Strength saving throw if it's a creature that is up to one size category larger than you. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone.

<h2>Reprisal (2)</h2>
When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make a horn attack against the creature. On a hit, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn.

<h2>Battering Ram (3)</h2>
As an action, you can move up to your speed as you charge in a straight line, during which you can enter other creatures' spaces and creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you. While charging, you can make a number of horn attacks against creatures within 5 feet of you as if you had taken the Attack action. One creature that is up to one size category larger than you and which you hit must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed forward to the end of your charge. If the target ends its movement adjacent to another creature or a solid object, both the pushed target and the creature or object take bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier. This maneuver deals double damage to objects and structures.

<h2>Tail Sweep (3)</h2>
As a bonus action, make a tail attack against up to two targets, both of which must be within your reach. Roll separately for each. If the attack hits, a target must make a Strength saving throw if it's a creature that is up to one size category larger than you. On a failed save, a target is pushed 15 feet away from you.

<h2>Wrath (3)</h2>
As a bonus action, make a claw attack against each creature of your choice within 5 feet of you.

<h2>Wrest Magic (3)</h2>
When a spell effect passes within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to redirect it to yourself. You become the target of the effect. If the effect creates an area, it is centered on you. If the spell requires you to make a saving throw, you have advantage on it. After the effects of the spell are resolved, you regain hit points equal to twice the level of the spell + your Constitution modifier. You can't target spells with a range of touch or self.
