        <h1>Embodiment of the Dragon Queen</h1>
        Worshiped in secret by cults, and spoken of in whispers by more upstanding citizens of the world, the legend of the Dragon Queen is known to all across the realm. With five heads, each wielding the power of a different element, her devastation and cruelty is unmatched. Perhaps you have been given her blessing, or maybe you strive to emulate a measure of her power. Whatever your reasons, your transformation into a multi-headed creature of horror has only just begun.
<h2>Better than One</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you grow another head. This new head has all the capabilities as your first, minus the ability to use your original breath weapon, and shares your mind and will. When you gain this new head, and for each new head hereafter, select a new breath weapon option from those available to you from the Dragon's Breath feature.<br><br>
You can not select a damage type you have already chosen, and you do not gain additional damage resistances from these choices through Elemental Adaptation. The damage type and breath weapon you have chosen for the new head is unique to that head alone. Your original head's elemental damage type is the same as your original breath weapon's.<br><br>
When you use your Dragon's Breath, choose which one of your heads' breath weapons to use for that feature. This doesn't give additional uses of Dragon's Breath, but rather expands your elemental damage and area of effect options.<br><br>
If you are targeted by an effect that would cut off one of your heads, you choose which head to lose and do not die so long as you have one head remaining. While the head is detached, you lose access to its elemental damage type and breath weapon.<br><br>
The missing head can be restored by any effect that can replace or restore limbs, or by spending a week's worth of downtime in deep focus.<br><br>
When you reach level 6, and again at levels 10 and 17, you gain an additional head as per this feature, for a total of five heads at level 17.
<h2>Elemental Fury</h2>
Also at 3rd level, when you take the Attack action, you can blast a nearby target with elemental power as a bonus action. Make a ranged Dragon Spark attack with a range of 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes damage equal to 1d4 + your Charisma modifier. The damage type is one of the elemental types possessed by one of your heads. The damage die increases to 1d6 at level 6, 1d8 at level 10, and 1d10 at level 17. This attack has advantage if the target of the attack is not one you have already hit with an attack on this turn.
<h2>Sleep with Two Eyes Open</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you have grown accustomed to your multi-headed nature and have begun to split your attention more efficiently. Whenever you take a long rest, so long as you have more than one head, one of your heads remains awake enough to keep watch for danger. While sleeping, you can use this head to see and hear as normal.<br><br>
Additionally, while you have more than one head, you have advantage on initiative checks and saving throws against the Blinded and Deafened conditions, and can no longer be surprised.
<h2>Onslaught</h2>
At 10th level, your heads act in perfect unison. When you use your Dragon's Breath feature, you can also use a bonus action to make a bite attack with a different head.
<h2>Terror of The Nine Hells</h2>
Also at 10th level, your form has become something truly frightening to behold. You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill. If you already have proficiency in Intimidation, your proficiency bonus is doubled for that skill.<br><br>
Additionally, while you have more than one head, you have advantage on saving throws against being Stunned or knocked Unconscious.
<h2>Fanged Frenzy</h2>
At 17th level, nothing can escape your fury. You gain an additional reaction each turn that can only be used to make an attack of opportunity with your bite attack, and creatures that willingly move while within 5 feet of you trigger an attack of opportunity.
