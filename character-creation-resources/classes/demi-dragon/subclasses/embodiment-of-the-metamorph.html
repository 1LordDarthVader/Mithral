        <h1>Embodiment of the Metamorph</h1>
        Metamorphs are demi-dragons that learn to master and manipulate the secrets that drove their initial transformation. They grasp the ability to reshape their own bodies, adapting themselves to overcome the challenges that are brought on by their changing surroundings. Some metamorphs use this ability purely to solve practical problems or to enhance their draconic nature, while others instead express themselves freely by taking on fantastical traits of their choosing-such as by imitating the brightly-colored feathered wings of the coautl, or the flowing mane of a ki-rin.
<h2>Adaptive Morph</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, your form is an ever-shifting canvas, constantly changing to reflect your circumstances.
<h3>Morphs</h3>
        You learn three <a href="../morph-list.html">morph categories</a> of your choice.<br><br>
You learn two additional morph categories of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 17th level. Each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one morph category you know with a different one.
<h3>Active Category</h3>
As part of a short or long rest, you undergo a metamorphosis which grants you new benefits. Choose one morph category that you know. The morph category you choose becomes your Active category, granting you one of its two listed features (your choice). This morph lasts indefinitely, or until you choose to change it again.
<h3>Waning Morph</h3>
When you change your Active Category to a different one, the morph you chose as part of that category becomes &quot;Waning&quot;. You keep the benefits of the morph, but you are one step closer to forfeiting it. When you change your Active category again, the effect of the previously Waning morph is lost, and the morph of your previously Active category becomes Waning. In this manner, you are always gaining and discarding new effects.
<h2>Swift Adaptation</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can rapidly adjust to new surroundings. If you spend 1 minute in deep focus, you can assume a new morph from among those you have learned. Choose a new Active Category and one of its morphs, and discard old morphs as if you had changed morphs during a rest. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Twinned Adaptation</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your morphs carry side effects with them. Whenever you choose an Active Category, you gain both the benefits listed in that category. When you choose a new Active Category, you choose one morph from the previously Active Category to keep as a Waning morph and one to discard.
<h2>Fueling the Transformation</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your form is so malleable that it only needs a spark of energy to change entirely. When you use Devour Magic, or upon completing the goal of your Resolution, you can additionally choose to immediately change your form. If you do, choose a new Active Category that you know and one of its morphs, and discard old morphs as if you had changed morphs during a rest.
<h2>Remake Self</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you gain the ability to remake yourself from the ground up. As part of a long rest, you can choose to undergo a metamorphic ritual, during which you cocoon yourself as you rework the nature of your being. This allows you to change your past choices. Change each of the following to your liking:
<ul>
<li><strong>Dragon's Breath Damage Type:</strong> acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison</li>
<li><strong>Dragon's Breath Area Effect:</strong> line or cone</li>
<li><strong>Elemental Adaptation Damage Type:</strong> acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison</li>
<li><strong>Eye of the Dragon Proficiency:</strong> perception or investigation</li>
</ul>
Upon completing the ritual, any ability score damage, scars suffered, or limbs lost are restored. Once initiated, the ritual can't be interrupted. You are helpless and unconscious for the full duration, and can only be stopped by an untimely death.
<h2>Essence of Change</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you understand change like few others. Unless you choose to be affected, your form can't be changed against your will, such as by the polymorph spell or a Medusa's Petrifying Gaze.
<h2>Flawless Metamorphosis</h2>
Starting at 17th level, you have nigh-total control over your transformation. You can retain one additional Waning morph, and when you change morphs, you can choose to change each of your previously Waning morphs to any morph from any category you know.
