        <h1>Embodiment of the Shadestalker</h1>
        Some demi-dragons are rejected or feared by those around them, and soon learn the value of subterfuge and a quick get-away. These demi-dragons may opt to pursue the role of the Shadestalker, honing their senses and learning to act both as predator and prey. By altering their breath to confound their foes with smoke or mist, Shadestalkers lure their enemies into giving chase, then strike when they have the advantage.
<h2>Spring Attacker</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you learn to exploit any opening to strike unopposed. As a bonus action, you can grant yourself advantage on the next melee weapon attack roll you make this turn. Additionally, you don't provoke opportunity attacks until the end of your turn.
<h2>Keen Predator</h2>
Predatory instincts awaken within you. When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, you can choose to add your Charisma modifier to the roll, instead of your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, you gain blindsight out to 10 feet. When you gain Eye of the Dragon at 9th level, it increases to 20 feet.
<h2>Veil of Smoke</h2>
You learn to use your breath to create a veil of smoke, shadow, mist, or fog to confound your foes. As an action, you breathe forth smoke which fills two 15-foot cubes, placing them in extension of you and each other. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. During your own turn or at the end of another creature's turn, you can use your reaction to beat your wings and blow each cube within 15 feet of you up to 15 feet in a direction of your choice.<br><br>
You can use this feature once, and must then complete a short or long rest before you can use it again. At 10th level, you gain another cube, for a total of three.
<h2>Fade and Ambush</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you vanish and reappear abruptly. Immediately after ending your turn, you can take the Hide action as a reaction if you are invisible or heavily obscured.<br><br>
Additionally, whenever you hit with a melee weapon attack which you had advantage on, the target of your attack must make a Wisdom save against your Dragon Spark save DC. On a failure, the target becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. A target that succeeds on this save is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
<h2>Blood and Smoke</h2>
Starting at 17th level, smoke clings to you as you burst from concealment, and when you strike, you leave your enemies bleeding and crippled. If you start your turn while heavily obscured or hidden, you become invisible until the end of your turn.<br><br>
Additionally, the speed reduction of your Rend and Ruin lasts for 1 minute.
