        <h1>Embodiment of the Shadestalker</h1>
        Some demi-dragons are rejected or feared by those around them, and soon learn the value of subterfuge and a quick get-away. These demi-dragons may opt to pursue the role of the Shadestalker, honing their senses and learning to act both as predator and prey. By altering their breath to confound their foes with smoke or mist, Shadestalkers lure their enemies into giving chase, then strike when they have the advantage.
<h2>Umbral Lunge</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, You can become a shade and dart forward. Once on each of your turns while you aren't grappled, incapacitated, or prone, you can choose an unoccupied space which you can see within 15 feet of you. You can act as if you occupy that space, instead of your own. Shadows pull you back and end the effect when you move, at the end of your turn, or if you choose to end it early (no action required).
<h2>Keen Predator</h2>
Predatory instincts awaken in you. You can use your Dragon Spark ability modifier in place of your Dexterity modifier when making Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws. Additionally, you gain blindsight out to 10 feet. When you gain Eye of the Dragon, this range increases to 20 feet.
<h2>Shade Veil</h2>
You can create an area of sheltering shadows. As a bonus action, you choose a point within your Cone Range from which spreads a 15-foot cube of magical darkness. The darkness spreads around corners, a creature with darkvision can't see through the darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. The darkness lasts for 1 minute, or until you choose to dismiss it early as a bonus action. You can use this feature three times, and must then complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
<h2>Fade and Ambush</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you vanish and reappear abruptly. Immediately after ending your turn, you can take the Hide action as a reaction.<br><br>
Additionally, whenever you hit with a melee weapon attack which you had advantage on, the target of your attack must make a Wisdom save against your Dragon Spark save DC. On a failure, the target becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. A target that succeeds on this save is immune to this effect for the next 8 hours.
<h2>Blood and Smoke</h2>
Starting at 17th level, smoke clings to you as you burst from concealment, and when you strike, you leave your enemies bleeding and crippled. If you start your turn while heavily obscured or hidden, you become invisible until the end of your turn.<br><br>
Additionally, the speed reduction of your Rend and Ruin lasts for 1 minute.
