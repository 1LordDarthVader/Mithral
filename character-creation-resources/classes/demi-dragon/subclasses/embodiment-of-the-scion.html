        <h1>Embodiment of the Scion</h1>
        Scions are demi-dragons who commit themselves fully to dragonkind. The purity of their elemental spark makes them nearly indistinguishable from true dragons, inheriting their most iconic traits. Scions dedicate themselves to a specific draconic bloodline from which they draw their power.
<h2>Bloodline Heritage</h2>
You grow closer to one of the ten draconic bloodlines, taking on the physical appearance of a dragon of that type.<br><br>
Choose a dragon type from the table below. The type chosen must match the damage type you chose for Dragon's Breath. You gain a climbing, swimming, or burrowing speed depending on your choice.<br><br>
If you gain a climbing speed, it is equal to your walking speed and you suffer no ill effects from high altitudes. If you gain a swimming speed, it is equal to your walking speed and you can breathe both air and water. If you gain a burrowing speed, it is equal to half your walking speed and you can tunnel through loose dirt, gravel, and similar materials, but not through solid materials. If you burrow at half speed, you can reinforce your tunnel as you move, letting others safely pass through—otherwise it slowly collapses behind you.

<h2>Ardent Breath</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you inherit the unique properties of your bloodline's breath weapon. Depending on your Bloodline Heritage, you gain a unique breath ability. You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so once you finish a short or long rest. At 6th level, you can use this feature twice.<br><br>
Each Ardent Breath uses the numbers listed in the Dragon's Breath Range column of the Demi-Dragon class table, and increases in range as you gain levels. It uses the specified line or cone regardless of what you chose for Dragon's Breath.
<h3>Acid Barrage</h3>
As an action, you launch bursts of acid at up to 3 nearby targets that you can see and which are within a number of feet equal to your Dragon's Breath Line distance. Make a ranged Dragon Spark attack against each target. On a hit, the target takes acid damage equal to your Dragon's Breath Damage.
<h3>Beguiling Miasma</h3>
As a bonus action, you breathe forth a vaporous poison, which billows around one creature you can see that is within the range of your Line Range. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Dragon Spark save DC or become charmed by you for 1 minute. If the charmed target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. While charmed in this way, the target is poisoned. At the end of the charmed creature's turn, every creature of your choice within 5 feet of the charmed creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Dragon Spark save DC or become poisoned until the start of the charmed creature's next turn.
<h3>Fiery Eruption</h3>
As an action, you lob a ball of fire at a square that you can see within the range of your Line Range, which explodes into a 5-foot-wide, 20-foot-tall cylinder of fire. Each creature in the eruption's area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Dragon Spark save DC or take fire damage equal to twice the damage dice of your Dragon's Breath Damage on a failed save, or half as much of the total damage on a successful one.
<h3>Freezing Mist</h3>
As an action, you breathe a freezing mist forth, which fills a sphere equal in diameter to your Cone Range, centered on a point within range of your Line Range. The mist spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. Each creature other than you in the mist when it appears or which ends its turn in the mist must make a Constitution saving throw against your Dragon Spark save DC or take cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage follows the progression of your Dragon's Breath Damage, but using d4s in place of d8s. The mist lasts until the start of your next turn.
<h3>Lightning Lance</h3>
As a bonus action, your breath forms a beam of crackling energy between yourself and a target within the range of your Line Range, creating a sustained arc of lightning. Make a Dragon Spark attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes lightning damage, and on each of your turns for up to 1 minute thereafter, you can use your bonus action to automatically deal further lightning damage to the target. The damage follows the progression of your Dragon's Breath Damage, but using d4s in place of d8s. The effect ends if you use your bonus action to do anything else. The effect also ends if the target is ever outside the range of your Line Range or if it has total cover from you. While the effect lasts, your bite attacks deal lightning damage instead of the piercing damage normal for a bite attack.
<h2>Ardent Focus</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you've learned how to get the most out of your Ardent Breath. Depending on your breath weapon damage type, you gain the following benefit:
<h3>Corrosion</h3>
Before the end of your next turn, the next attack roll made against each target hit by your Acid Barrage has advantage.
<h3>Induce Torpor</h3>
As an action while the charmed target of your Beguiling Miasma is within 10 feet of you, you can force the target to make a Constitution saving throw against your Dragon Spark save DC or be rendered unconscious for up to 1d4 hours. If the unconscious creature takes any damage, it wakes up.
<h3>Explosive Departure</h3>
When you use Fiery Eruption, you can use your bonus action to take flight and launch yourself 15 feet into the air. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
<h3>Glacial Chill</h3>
Creatures that fail their saving throw against your Freezing Mist have their speed halved until the end of their next turn.
<h3>Sweeping Lightning</h3>
As a reaction when Lightning Lance misses its initial target or would end, you can redirect the beam of lightning to another target. Make a Dragon Spark attack against a different target that is within range. On a hit, the target takes no damage, but becomes the new target of your Lightning Lance. Once you use your reaction in this way, you can't do so again until you initiate Lightning Lance again.
<h2>Elemental Suffusion</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you've grown fully attuned to your bloodline. You are immune to the damage type you chose for Dragon's Breath.
<h2>Frightful Roar</h2>
Starting at 17th level, your heritage lets you inspire fear in those around you. As an action, each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you is forced to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Dragon Spark save DC. A target automatically succeeds on the save if it can't hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes frightened of you for 1 minute.<br><br>
You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so after finishing a long rest.
