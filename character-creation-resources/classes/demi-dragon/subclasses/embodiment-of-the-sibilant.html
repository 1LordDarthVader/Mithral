        <h1>Embodiment of the Sibilant</h1>
        Sibilants are psionic manipulators who prefer to quietly and selectively influence those around them in their own favor, whispering unassuming suggestions that play into their plans. A sibilant will compel their foes to step right into the path of their elemental breath without them even realizing.
<h2>Sibilant Mind</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, Your psionic mind lets you manipulate those who surround you, or protect yourself from attackers. As a bonus action, you gain one of the following benefits which lasts until you choose the other option:
<h3>Beckoning Influence</h3>
When you spend your action to take the Attack, Dodge, or Dragon's Breath actions, you can nudge the mind of a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you as part of that action. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Dragon Spark save DC or immediately move up to 10 feet in a direction of your choosing. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and occurs before your action. A creature can willingly fail this save. At 10th level, you can influence up to two different targets.
<h3>Bolstering Backlash</h3>
As a reaction when a creature forces you to make a saving throw, you can choose to lash out at the offender with your mind. The creature takes 1d4 psychic damage. You gain a bonus to your saving throw equal to the damage dealt. At 10th level, the damage increases to 1d8.
<h2>Telepathic</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Your telepathic utterances are in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Your communication doesn't give the creature the ability to respond to you telepathically.
<h2>Obfuscate Consciousness</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can infiltrate the minds of others to change how they see you. As a bonus action, choose a creature within 120 feet of you that you are aware of. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for 10 minutes. Additionally, you alter the creature's perception of you, choosing from the following secondary effects:
<ul>
<li>You appear to the target as a completely different creature of your choice, looking and sounding as you determine</li>
<li>You erase yourself from the target's vision. The target treats you as if you were invisible</li>
<li>You appear to the target as a haunting vision. The target is frightened of you and deafened to all around it save you</li>
</ul>
If the charmed target takes any damage, the charm ends, but the secondary effect persists for the remaining duration. You can use this feature once, and must then finish a short or long rest to use it again.
<h2>Clarity of Thought</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your careful planning and disciplined thoughts leave no room for error. You cannot be charmed. Additionally, whenever you start your turn with no hostile creature within 5 feet of you, you can add your dragon spark ability score modifier to one damage roll you make before the end of your turn.
<h2>Overwhelming Desolation</h2>
Starting at 10th level, amidst the destruction of your elemental breath reigns confusion. When you use your Dragon's Breath feature, you can use your bonus action to psionically overwhelm one target that failed its save against your Dragon's Breath. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Dragon Spark save DC or be incapacitated until the end of their next turn.
<h2>Dominion of Perceptions</h2>
Starting at 17th level, you leave a web of altered perception in your wake. When you use Obfuscate Consciousness, you can choose to concentrate (as if on a spell) for up to 1 hour afterwards. While concentrating in this manner, you can use Obfuscate Consciousness at will, but cannot target the same creature more than once.
