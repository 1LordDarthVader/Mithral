        <h1>Embodiment of the Fervent Hoarder</h1>
        Fervent Hoarders hold a singular desire in their heart, and take up adventuring to sate it. Hoarders form a special bond with an object that they covet, binding it tightly to the Weave of magic as a focus for their own extraordinary power. Though many Hoarders desire glittering gold, their magical bond can take the form of any beloved object.
<h2>Heart of the Hoard</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, the pride and joy of your hoard takes the form of a special centerpiece item, which is imbued with your draconic magic as a nascent focal point of your lair. During a short or long rest, you can designate one item in your possession as your hoard centerpiece. The item can benefit from any enchantments that you have available via Absorb Magic as if it were a part of you, but is also subject to the same restrictions. When you designate an item, choose from the following benefits to apply to it:
<strong>Reach of the Hoard.</strong> The centerpiece item takes the form of a melee weapon, a rod, a large gemstone, a piece of furniture, a collection of coins, or some other perilous object. You can magically float the centerpiece item while it remains within 20 feet of you, and you can use it to make melee weapon attacks. It counts as a natural melee weapon for you, and you add your Charisma modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The centerpiece item deals 2d6 damage of a type determined by the DM and has a reach of 20 feet, but cannot be used to make opportunity attacks. When you attack with the centerpiece item, you can optionally choose to conjure a spectral copy of it as part of the attack.
<strong>Fortification of the Hoard.</strong> The centerpiece item takes the form of a piece of armor, a series of gemstones embedded in your hide, a lucky talisman, or some other protective object. The centerpiece item has 3 charges. While the centerpiece item is in your possession, when you are hit by an attack or fail a saving throw, you can choose to expend 1 charge and roll a d6. You add the result both to your AC and to each of your saving throws that you make until the start of your next turn. You regain all charges when you finish a short rest.
<strong>Ingenuity of the Hoard.</strong> The centerpiece item takes the form of an amulet, a piece of clothing or jewelry, a beloved plushie, a coin or other currency, a book, or some other precious object. When you first select this option for Heart of the Hoard, you can choose one cantrip and a number of spells from the /arcane-spell-list">arcane spell list. See the table below to determine how many spells you know and the highest spell level that is available to you. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose new sorcerer spells and cantrips.<br><br>
The centerpiece item acts as an arcane focus for you. While the centerpiece item is in your possession, you can cast the spells at the highest spell level available to you, using your Dragon Spark as your spellcasting ability.<br><br>
Once you cast a spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. At 11th level, you can cast two spells before a rest.

<h2>True Treasure</h2>
Your fascination with a particular type of treasure manifests as a keen knowledge in a related field of artisanry, and a unique magical talent for handling your property. You gain proficiency in one set of artisan's tools of your choice.<br><br>
Additionally, as an action you can magically float up to 50 pounds of items which you own, which remain in place as you designate for 1 minute or until you are ever more than 20 feet away from the item, after which the items gently descend to the ground. As an action while floating the items, you can manipulate one item as if you were holding it, and can use any of your proficiencies with it.
<h2>Manifest Lair</h2>
Starting at 6th level, a hoard serves as the magical anchor for a lair, and as an adventuring dragon, you've learned to rapidly form and sever the magical connections that signify a lair. As an action, you establish a connection to all nearby terrain within a 60 feet radius of your centerpiece item. Your lair lasts until the centerpiece item is moved from within the range of the established lair, until you manifest a new lair, or until you die.<br><br>
While you are within your lair, you can take one of the following reactions of your choice at the end of any other creature's turn.
<ul>
<li><strong>Whisk Away.</strong> A tapestry, carpet, gust of wind, or magic wand instantaneously transports a willing creature within your lair up to 30 feet in a direction of your choosing.</li>
<li><strong>Hoard Barrage.</strong> Your hoard magically launches one object that you own at a target that you can see within 120 feet. Make a ranged spell attack using your Dragon Spark. On a hit, the target takes damage equal to 1d4 + your dragon spark ability score modifier. The type of damage dealt is determined by the DM.</li>
<li><strong>Shelter of the Lair.</strong> Your lair conceals those within. One willing creature of your choice becomes invisible until the start of their next turn. The creature can choose to take the Hide action as a reaction.</li>
</ul>
Once you manifest your lair, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Claim Item</h2>
Starting at 10th level, all that you survey is yours to wield. As an action, you immediately attune to a magical item that is in your possession and is not attuned to another creature. If doing so would cause you to be attuned to more than your maximum attuned items, you can choose to immediately un-attune from one other item as part of the action.<br><br>
When you attune or un-attune to an item in this way, you can additionally choose to use Absorb Magic to absorb or return the item's enchantment. If you do, the item must remain in your possession for 1 hour, else the enchantment returns to the item at the end of the hour.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, after which you must finish a long rest to use it again.
<h2>Homey Lair</h2>
Starting at 10th level, given a little time to settle in, you can make improvements to your new home. When you finish a long rest while resting in the area of your Manifest Lair, you can choose a spell from the following list which takes effect: druid grove, guards and wards, programmed illusion, and project image. You determine the effects of the spell as if you had cast it, but all effects must be within the radius of your lair and cannot leave it. Only one of these spells can be active at any one time, and the spell immediately ends if Manifest Lair ends. The spell does not require you to concentrate on it.
<h2>Splendor</h2>
Starting at 17th level, the crowning glory of your hoard is a true marvel. When you designate an item as your centerpiece item during a short or long rest, you can choose two of the features detailed in Heart of the Hoard. You gain the benefits of both.
