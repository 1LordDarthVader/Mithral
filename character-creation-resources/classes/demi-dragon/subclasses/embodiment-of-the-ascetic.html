        <h1>Embodiment of the Ascetic</h1>
        Ascetics devote themselves to contemplation and worship. By seeking to better themselves through spiritual and physical training, Ascetics harness the magical nature of their Dragon Spark, developing it into an ember of ineffable power which they use to aid and protect their allies.
<h2>Imbue Breath</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can invest allies with the blessing of your breath. As a bonus action when you use Dragon's Breath, you can anoint yourself or one creature in your breath's area with your elemental might. The target takes no damage from your Dragon's Breath as your elemental energy harmlessly swirls around it and empowers its weapon attacks to deal 1d4 extra damage. The damage is of the same type as your Dragon's Breath, and the target additionally has resistance to that damage type. These effects last for 1 minute.<br><br>
You can use this feature twice, after which you must finish a short or long rest to use it again. At 13th level, you can use it three times before a rest.
<h2>Disciple's Meditation</h2>
You can focus your Dragon Spark to mend wounds. If you or one other creature of your choice regains hit points by spending Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, the target regains an extra 2d6 hit points. The extra hit points increase to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 10th level, and 5d6 at 17th level.
<h2>Anointed Blessings</h2>
Starting at 6th level, the gift of your breath imbues greater boons. When you use Imbue Breath on a creature, you can additionally grant the creature one of the following additional effects:
<ul>
<li><strong>Bravery of the Venerated.</strong> You speak of the weight of ages and the tenacity of passing, and your gifted breath takes the form of a symbol of protection. While the benefit lasts, the target of your Imbue Breath is immune to being frightened and gains temporary hit points equal to your dragon spark ability score modifier (minimum 1) + your Proficiency bonus at the start of each of its turns.</li>
<li><strong>Might of Dominion.</strong> You speak of legend and myth carved by deeds, and your gifted breath flows and shapes with the gesture of its wielder. Once per turn while the benefit lasts, when the target of your Imbue Breath deals damage to a creature, they can choose to deal additional elemental damage equal to your spellcasting ability score modifier (minimum 1) to every creature of their choice within 5 feet of the initial target. The damage type is the same as your Dragon's Breath.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bestow Grace</h2>
Starting at 10th level, your Dragon Spark can bond your breath to a creature. When you use Imbue Breath on a creature, you can additionally grant the creature one of the following additional effects:
<ul>
<li><strong>Gift of Flight.</strong> Your gifted breath forms a pair of wings shaped by elemental power. While the benefit lasts, the target of your Imbue Breath gains a flying speed of 40 feet. If you target a creature that already has a flying speed, it instead increases by 20 feet.</li>
<li><strong>Crown of the Irrepressible.</strong> Your gifted breath forms a set of horns shaped by elemental power upon the target's brow, and the receiver experiences a feeling of stubborn defiance. While the benefit lasts, the target of your Imbue Breath is immune to being knocked prone and unconscious. Whenever the target is rendered stunned or paralyzed, they are instead only incapacitated.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sage Wisdom</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you become a conduit for the teachings of dragon sages. At the end of a short rest, the target of your Disciple's Meditation can ask one question that can be answered with a yes or no. The sages speak through you, and give a correct answer for the question. The DM provides the answer.<br><br>
The sages aren't omniscient, so you might receive &quot;unclear&quot; as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond their knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the sages' teachings, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.
<h2>Ineffable Paragon</h2>
Starting at 17th level, your selfless dedication has exalted your being. Choose one of the effects from Anointed Blessings or Bestow Grace. You gain the chosen effect permanently. You can change your choice each time you finish a short or long rest.
