<h1>Embodiment of the Creeping Doom</h1>

<h2>Dread Aspect</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can manifest a terrifying presence. As a bonus action, you unveil your frightful might for 1 minute. You gain the following benefits.

<ul>
    <li>You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your demi-dragon level.</li>
    <li>Once during each of your turns, you can deal additional necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier to one target that you dealt damage to.</li>
    <li>At the end of each of your turns, each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Dragon Spark save DC or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 hour.</li>
</ul>

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you have finished a short or long rest. At 10th level, you can use it twice before a rest.

<h2>Frightful Gaze</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your gaze incites supernatural fear. As a bonus action, you focus your glare on a creature within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Dragon Spark save DC or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. A target automatically succeeds on the save if it can't hear or see you.

<h2>Oppressive Gloom</h2>
Also at 6th level, your fell presence weighs heavily on your enemies. Creatures who are frightened of you have their speed reduced by half, and have disadvantage on their saving throws against your demi-dragon class features while you are within their line of sight.

<h2>Undying Legacy</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you are very difficult to kill. You automatically succeed on death saving throws you make. Additionally, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. When you do, you discorporate, dispersing into the form of a lingering shadow. While in this form, you can enter and occupy the space of another creature. You become immune to nonmagical damage, and you automatically succeed on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. You can pass through small holes, narrow openings, liquids and even mere cracks. You can't fall and you remain hovering in the air even when stunned, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated. While in the form of a shadow, you can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects you were carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. You can't attack or cast spells, but you can use your Dread Aspect and Frightful Gaze features.

<br><br>You remain in this form for up to 1 hour. You can reform a corporeal body early as an action. Once you've used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

<h2>Disjunction Breath</h2>
Starting at 17th level, you've discovered a fundamental truth about the nature of a dragon's magical breath. You have advantage on the ability check check you make for Devour Magic. Additionally, When you use Devour Magic, you can choose to cause the dispel to affect every magical effect within a cone equal in range to your Cone Range listed in the Dragon's Breath Range column of the Demi-Dragon class table.
