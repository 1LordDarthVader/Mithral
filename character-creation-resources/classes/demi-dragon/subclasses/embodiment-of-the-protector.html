        <h1>Embodiment of the Protector</h1>
        Some demi-dragons choose a path of protection. These demi-dragons are often of a metallic or even an earthen hue. Those that choose to embody protection become a stalwart shield to their allies, emboldening themselves with the magical power of their foes.
<h2>Shelter the Brood</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, your wings grow thick plates of armor and your bones strengthen. You can use your wings to protect yourself and your allies. As a bonus action, you can spread your wings in an area around you. Until the start of your next turn, you and creatures of your choosing within 5 ft. of you are considered to be behind half cover. If a creature moves within 5 ft. of you while this ability is active, you can choose to extend the bonus of this ability to them.
<h2>Strength of Steel</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, like true steel dragons, you are resistant to magic. Whenever you are subjected to any non-cantrip magical effect, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) before the spell's effects are resolved.
<h2>Rapid Response</h2>
Starting at 6th level, in battle, your watchful alertness is matched only by the speed of your response . Whenever a creature that is granted cover from your Shelter the Brood is attacked, you can make a tail attack against the attacking creature as a reaction.
<h2>Vigorous Wings</h2>
Starting at 10th level, the edges of your wings are bladed like those of a steel dragon. You can use your wings as natural weapons, with which you are proficient, to make melee weapon attacks. When you attack with them, your wings shear an area dealing 1d4 + your Strength modifier slashing damage to each enemy in a 10 ft. cone. You choose where the cone originates within your reach, and where it is directed towards. Roll separately for each target in the cone.
<h2>Wings of Protection</h2>
Starting at 17th level, you are a living avatar of protection to any who find themselves under your watchful gaze. When a friendly creature that you can see is the target of an attack, you can use your reaction to move up to 30 ft. using your glide or flying speed and resolve that attack with yourself as the target. If the attack would still hit you, you reduce the damage that you take by an amount equal to your Constitution + dragon spark ability score modifiers.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
