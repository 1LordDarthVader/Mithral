        <h1>Embodiment of the Arbiter</h1>
        Arbiters tap into their inner strength through magic by binding spells to their very form. Arbiters learn esoteric magical secrets that aid them in enhancing their own natural abilities with spells, while seeking to deny their enemies the chance to retaliate with magic of their own.

<h2>Arcane Wellspring</h2>
        <a class="breadcrumb" href="../../spells/classes/arcane.html">Arcane Spell List</a><br><br>
You begin to tap into your innate dragon magic and gain the ability to cast spells.
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the arcane spell list. You learn an additional arcane cantrip of your choice at 10th level.
<h3>Spell Points</h3>
You have a number of spell points at a given level, as shown in the Spell Points column of the Arbiter Spellcasting table. In order to cast a spell, you must expend number of spell points determined by the level the spell is being cast at, as shown below:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Spell Level</th>
<th>Point Cost</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
</table>
You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.
<h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
You know two 1st-level arcane spells of your choice. Both must be from the abjuration, evocation, or transmutation schools.<br><br>
The Spells Known column of the Arbiter Spellcasting table shows when you can learn more arcane spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment and evocation spell of your choice, and must be equal to or lower than the maximum level of spells you can cast, as shown in the Max Spell Level column of the Arbiter Spellcasting table.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the arcane spells you know with another spell of your choice from the arcane spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration, evocation, or transmutation spell.
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
Constitution, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for your arcane spells, since your magic draws from the power and dominance of dragons.
<strong>Spell Save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier<br />
<strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier
<h2>Scale Bind</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to mystically bind spells to your scales. Doing so takes 1 minute, during which you expend a spell slot to imbue the desired spell. While the spell remains bound, you can cast the spell as a reaction at any time.<br><br>
If the spell requires concentration, it lasts for the full duration and doesn't take up your concentration. Once cast with a reaction, Scale Bind ends.<br><br>
As an action, you can rip loose the scale upon which the spell is bound and throw it up to 30 feet. The binding remains intact unless the scale is destroyed, and can be triggered with a reaction as normal, given a valid target for the bound spell which you are aware of.<br><br>
While the spell remains bound, the scale bears a glowing runic sigil and appears as obviously magical. The spell remains bound for up to 8 hours if not triggered, after which the effect dissipates. You can only bind spells that normally take an action, reaction, or bonus action to cast, and which are of a spell level which your Arbiter level allows you to cast.<br><br>
You can use this feature once, and you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
<h2>Focal Point</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you now regain use of your Scale Bind feature when you finish a short rest.<br><br>
Additionally, while the scale is detached from you and the spell remains bound, you can use an action to perceive through the scale as if you were in its space until the start of your next turn, using your own senses.
<h2>Unmaker's Sight</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you've studied both the creation and destruction of magic, and have developed an unerring sight for the mystical. You gain the ability to cast detect magic and identify at will. Additionally, you add Dispel Magic and Counterspell to your spells known, and you can cast them each once per long rest without expending a spell slot.
<h2>Weave and Unweave</h2>
Starting at 17th level, you've learned how to fuel your spells with the sundered power of your enemies. Whenever you use Devour Magic or cast dispel magic, you can immediately use your bonus action to cast a spell of 2nd level or lower. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action or bonus action.
