        <h1>Embodiment of the Juggernaut</h1>
        Juggernauts face their foes head on and break them under a barrage of fury. Juggernauts rely on raw might and tenacity to wade into battle, using their multiple limbs to rip into their enemies with their powerful natural weapons.
<h2>By Any Means</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, your horns and wings are alternative means of attack. These natural weapons count as martial melee weapons for you, and you are proficient with them. You can use them to make melee weapon attacks, and you add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with them.
<ul>
<li>Your horns deal 2d4 piercing damage.</li>
<li>Your wings deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage. When you take the Attack action to attack with your claw or wing, you can use your bonus action to make an additional claw or wing attack.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fury</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, your body is a weapon of war. You learn special maneuvers which are fueled by a resource called fury.
<h3>Maneuvers</h3>
        You learn three <a href="../maneuver-list.html">maneuvers</a> of your choice. Many maneuvers require you to make an attack. Resolve the attack as you normally would while accounting for the additional effect of the maneuver.<br><br>
You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 6th, 10th, and 17th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.
<h3>Fury</h3>
You have 4 fury points. You regain all of your expended fury points when you finish a short or long rest.<br><br>
You can spend fury to perform a maneuver. Each maneuver costs fury points to use, noted in parentheses. You must be able to pay the fury cost to use the maneuver.<br><br>
Your maximum number of fury points increases by 2 at 6th, 10th, and 17th level.
<h3>Saving Throws</h3>
Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
<strong>Maneuver save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier
<h2>Tenacious Assault</h2>
Starting at 6th level, a fervor burns within you to enact your fury upon your enemies. When you use a maneuver as part of an attack, you have advantage on the attack roll.
<h2>Fearless</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you are immune to being frightened.
<h2>Heart of Battle</h2>
Starting at 10th level, when you use a maneuver, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice the fury points you spent. These temporary hit points last 1 minute.
<h2>Anvil of Will</h2>
Starting at 17th level, combat is the anvil of will, and you are its hammer. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against one of your demi-dragon class features, you can force it to reroll. It must use the new roll.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
