<h1>Morph Categories</h1>

<h2 id="toc0"><span>Aid</span></h2>
<h3 id="toc1"><span>Gold Luck</span></h3>
<p>You harness the mystic fortuity of the gold dragon. Whenever you or an ally makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can choose to roll an additional d20. You can take this action after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so after finishing a short or long rest.</p>
<h3 id="toc2"><span>Sheltering Wings</span></h3>
<p>Flexible armor plating grows across your wings, allowing you to use them as shelter for your allies. When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>
<h2 id="toc3"><span>Courage</span></h2>
<h3 id="toc4"><span>Warrior's Will</span></h3>
<p>You adorn your form with a symbol of bravery and prepare yourself to face opposition. You gain advantage on Wisdom saving throws.</p>
<h3 id="toc5"><span>Ivory Charge</span></h3>
<p>Your horns split into a branching crown of antlers, capable of punching holes through hide and armor alike. You gain an antler natural weapon, which counts as a martial melee weapon for you. You can use it to make melee weapon attacks, with which you are proficient. Your antlers deal piercing damage equal to 3d4 + your Strength modifier. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line during your turn, you gain advantage on the first attack you make with your antlers.</p>
<h2 id="toc6"><span>Creation</span></h2>
<h3 id="toc7"><span>Stone Scales</span></h3>
<p>You assimilate available minerals in order to create a thick layer of defensive stone scales. Your Armor Class becomes equal to 16 + your Constitution modifier. You are considered as wearing heavy armor, but don't suffer penalties to your Dexterity (Stealth) or as a result of lacking heavy armor proficiency. You lose access to the Flight feature, as well as the speed benefit of Stride.</p>
<h3 id="toc8"><span>Capable Form</span></h3>
<p>Your body grows better suited to grasping and manipulating objects. You can ignore the disadvantage imposed on attack on attack rolls by Mythic Build. Additionally, you gain proficiency with simple and martial weapons as well as with two tools of your choice. Once chosen, these tool proficiencies can't be changed with subsequent morphs.</p>
<h2 id="toc9"><span>Freedom</span></h2>
<h3 id="toc10"><span>Esoteric Ward</span></h3>

<h3 id="toc14"><span>Tunnel Wyrm</span></h3>
<p>You gain a burrowing speed equal to half your walking speed. You can tunnel through loose dirt, gravel, and similar materials, but not through solid materials. If you burrow at half speed, you can reinforce your tunnel as you move, allowing others to pass through-otherwise your tunnel slowly collapses behind you. Additionally, as an action while burrowing near the surface, you can hollow out a portion of space in the terrain, which immediately collapses into a 10-feet wide and deep sinkhole. Creatures caught in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Dragon Spark DC or fall into the sinkhole and drop prone. On a succesful save, a creature can instead choose to move to the nearest available space without provoking opportunity attacks. If you spend 1 minute creating the sinkhole, it will instead collapse when the first creature that is Small or larger moves into its space. You can use this property twice, after which you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>
<h2 id="toc15"><span>Heritage</span></h2>

<h2 id="toc21"><span>Might</span></h2>

Additionally, when you are dragging or carrying a grappled creature with you, your speed is no longer halved.</p>
<h2 id="toc27"><span>Pain</span></h2>
<h3 id="toc28"><span>Skewering Quills</span></h3>

Hit or miss, one square occupied by the targeted creature is then filled with quills, and you can additionally choose two squares within 5 feet of that square to also fill with quills as your inaccurate bombardment harmlessly scatters across the area. Any creature that subsequently enters a square filled with quills must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Dragon Spark save DC or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.

<h2 id="toc36"><span>Strategy</span></h2>
<h3 id="toc37"><span>Reverberating Roar</span></h3>
<p>Your voice grows deeper, seeming to come from a much larger creature. As a bonus action, you can roar, inciting fear and hesitation in your enemies.
