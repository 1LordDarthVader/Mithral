<h1>Demi-Dragon</h1>

Whether driven by fanatical beliefs, a hunger for personal power, or a genuine wish to help others by whatever means are available, some choose to undergo a ritual transformation that changes their body into an imitation of a true dragon. Other individuals concoct detailed magical experiments on unwilling subjects, exploring the limitations of the blood of dragons. Regardless of origin, the resulting creature is known as a demi-dragon - a being that was created rather than born.

A character must be of the <a href="./race.html">Demi-Dragon race</a> in order to take any levels in this class.

There are also a handful of <a href="./feats.html">Demi-Dragon exclusive feats</a>.

<h3>Dragon Spark</h3>
Starting at 1st level when you become a demi-dragon, you internalize a spark of inherent magical power that fuels your new form and allows you to mimic the extraordinary abilities of a true dragon. The power of this spark is a measure of the magical essence you have accumulated.
<br><br>
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice) is your ability for specific class features. You use your choice whenever a feature gained through this class refers to your Dragon Spark. In addition, you use your choice when setting the saving throw DC for such an effect and when making an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
<strong>Dragon Spark save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your dragon spark ability score modifier<br>
<strong>Dragon Spark attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your dragon spark ability score modifier
<h3>Devour Magic</h3>
Starting at 1st level, to sustain your new form, you have developed an innate ability that lets you consume magic. As an action, choose one creature, object, or magical effect within a range of 10 feet of you. Any spell of a level lower than or equal to one third your demi-dragon level (minimum 1) on the target is dispelled. For each spell of a level higher than that, make an ability check with your Dragon Spark ability score. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell is dispelled. Regardless of success, you then regain hit points equal to your demi-dragon level + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). Effects that refer to Dispel Magic also apply to this feature, such as wall of force.
<br><br>
You can use this feature once, and must finish a long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 5th level, the range increases to 60 feet. At 18th level, you can use it twice before a long rest.
<h3>Resolution</h3>
Optional Feature, replaces Devour Magic<br>
Starting at 1st level, you act with purpose and celebrate your triumphs. As a bonus action, you set your attention upon the accomplishment of a task-be it slaying a particular foe, obtaining an item not in your possession, or helping an ally in some manner. The task must be non-trivial in nature. While the task remains undone, you have advantage on your next Wisdom saving throw. When the task is accomplished, you regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your demi-dragon level. If you abandon the task or fail to complete it before 10 minutes have passed, these benefits are lost.
<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 18th level, you gain advantage on all Wisdom saving throws until the task is accomplished.
<h3>Dragon's Breath</h3>
Starting at 1st level, destructive energy simmers within you, waiting to be released. When you gain this feature, choose between a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone. Additionally, choose a damage type from among the following: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.
<br><br>
As an action, you exhale destructive energy. Each creature in the area you chose must make a saving throw against your Dragon Spark save DC. A creature takes 2d8 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If you chose acid, fire, or lightning, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. If you chose cold, poison, radiant, or thunder, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. If you chose Force, the target must make a Strength saving throw. If you chose Psychic, the target must make an Intelligence saving throw.
<br><br>
The damage and range of this feature increase as you gain demi-dragon levels, as shown in the Dragon's Breath Damage and Range columns of the Demi-Dragon table.
<br><br>
You can use this feature twice. You regain all uses of it after finishing a short or long rest. Starting at 13th level, you can use it three times before a rest.
<h3>Glide</h3>
Starting at 2nd level, your wings can slow your fall. As a reaction you can take when falling while you aren't prone, you can spread your wings and glide, slowing your rate of descent to 20 feet per round. While gliding, you can as part of your movement move up to 40 feet in any horizontal direction, or dive straight down. When you land, you take no falling damage and can land on your feet. You can also start gliding by expending at least 10 feet of movement as part of a high jump.
<br><br>
The speed at which you can glide increases as you gain demi-dragon levels, as shown in the Glide &amp; Fly Speed column of the Demi-Dragon table.
<h3>Elemental Adaptation</h3>
Starting at 2nd level, your form continues to change as you adapt to your newly-attained elemental nature. You gain resistance to the damage type you chose for Dragon's Breath.
<h3>Absorb Magic</h3>
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to absorb the magical enchantment of a weapon or piece of equipment. This grants you access to the magical powers provided by that item, and removes it from the item. The stolen magic harmlessly flows through your veins. You can absorb an enchantment from a magical item as part of a long rest, during which the item must be in your possession. Once absorbed, you can use the item's magical properties as if you were wearing or wielding the item. The stolen magical power follows all rules that would normally apply to it.
<br><br>
You can return the enchantment to the original item as part of a short or long rest. When returning an enchantment, you do not need to have the item in your possession.
<br><br>
You can have a maximum of 5 such enchantments active at any one time. If the item requires attunement to use, it follows normal attunement rules, and you count as being attuned while the enchantment remains absorbed by you. You can't absorb an item's magic if doing so would cause you to be attuned to more than your maximum attunements.
<br><br>
You can't absorb the power of shields or artifacts. Additionally, the Dungeon Master may rule that a specific item's enchantment can't be absorbed.
<br><br>
Only enchantments on items that are designed to be equipment (worn or wielded) may be absorbed. You can't combine these enchantments in any way that would not normally be possible-you can't, for instance, benefit from more than one weapon enchantment when making an attack, but if multiple such enchantments are available to you, you can decide which one to use each time you make an attack.
<br><br>
Should a cursed item be absorbed, the curse functions as normal. You can rid yourself of the curse after fulfilling its requirements, such as by using the remove curse spell. Doing so temporarily allows you to return the cursed enchantment to its item as part of a short or long rest.
<h3>Draconic Embodiment</h3>
At 3rd level, you choose an aspect of draconic might to dedicate yourself to. Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 17th level.

</ul>

<h3>Ability Score Increase</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
<h3>Extra Attack</h3>
Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
<h3>Stride</h3>
Starting at 5th level, you've become better used to your still-growing body. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.
<br><br>
Additionally, a creature that is the same size category as you or smaller can ride on your back if you allow it. In such a situation, you continue to act independently, not as a controlled mount.
<h3>Leeching Strikes</h3>
Starting at 6th level, your stolen magic empowers your attacks. All of your natural weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
<h3>Flight</h3>
Starting at 7th level, your wings have grown powerful enough to sustain flight. You gain a flying speed of 50 feet. You can only use this flying speed if you aren't wearing heavy armor and aren't encumbered.
<br><br>
Your flying speed increases as you gain demi-dragon levels, as shown in the Glide &amp; Fly Speed column of the Demi-Dragon table.
<h3>Eye of the Dragon</h3>
Starting at 9th level, your senses are keenly honed. You gain proficiency in your choice of the Perception or the Investigation skill. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for that skill.
<br><br>
Additionally, you gain blindsight out to a range of 10 feet. You faintly sense the location of any magical effect that is within the range of your blindsight, and innately know if such a magical effect can be dispelled.
<h3>Draconic Growth</h3>
At 10th level, your size increases to Large. At 20th level, your size increases to Huge.
<h3>Dragon's Might</h3>
Starting at 11th level, raw draconic vitality empowers you. Your Strength, Constitution, and dragon spark ability score scores each increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores is now 22.
<h3>Fabled Resistance</h3>
Starting at 14th level, the tenacity of dragons is legendary. You have two resistance dice, which are d6s. When you fail a saving throw, you can choose to roll one or more of your resistance dice, adding the result to your saving throw total. You can roll each die one by one. Once a resistance die has turned a failure into a success, the die is expended and cannot be used again until you have finished a long rest.
<br><br>
At 20th level, you gain another resistance dice for a total of three, and they each turn into d10s.
<h3>Force of Self</h3>
Starting at 15th level, through your perseverance, you've developed a strong sense of self. You gain proficiency in Charisma saving throws.
<h3>Rend and Ruin</h3>
Starting at 17th level, your savage strikes leave your foes broken and bleeding. Once on each of your turns if you deal damage to a target with at least two natural weapon attacks, the target takes an additional 3d6 damage of the same type, and has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
