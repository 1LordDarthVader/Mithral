    <h1>Adaptive Body</h1>
    



<p>You can alter your body to match your surroundings, allowing you to withstand punishing environments. With greater psi energy, you can extend this protection to others.</p>
<p><strong>Psychic Focus.</strong> While focused on this discipline, you don't need to eat, breathe, or sleep. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you can spend 8 hours engaged in light activity, rather than sleeping during any of it.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Adaptation (2 psi).</strong> As an action, you or a creature you touch ignores the effects of extreme heat or cold (but not cold or fire damage) for the next hour.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptive Shield (3 psi).</strong> When you take acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to damage of that type—including the triggering damage—until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Adaptation (5 psi; concentration, up to 1 hour).</strong> As an action, you can touch one creature and give it resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice), which lasts until your concentration ends.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Immunity (7 psi; concentration, up to 1 hour).</strong> As an action, you can touch one creature and give it immunity to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice), which lasts until your concentration ends.</p>
