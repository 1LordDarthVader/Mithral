    <h1>Diminution</h1>
    



<p>You manipulate the matter that composes your body, drastically reducing your size without surrendering any of your might.</p>
<p><strong>Psychic Focus.</strong> While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on Dexterity(Stealth) checks.</p>
<p><strong>Miniature Form (2 psi; concentration, up to 10 minutes).</strong> As a bonus action, you become Tiny until your concentration ends. While this size, you gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity(Stealth) checks and can move through gaps up to 6 inches across without squeezing.</p>
<p><strong>Toppling Shift (2 psi).</strong> As a bonus action, you shift to an incredibly small size and then suddenly return to normal, sending an opponent flying backward. Choose one creature you can see within 5 feet of you. It must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong>Sudden Shift (5 psi).</strong> As a reaction when you are hit by an attack, you shift down to minute size to avoid the attack. The attack misses, and you move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks before returning to normal size.</p>
<p><strong>Microscopic Form (7 psi; concentration, up to 10 minutes).</strong> As a bonus action, you become smaller than Tiny until your concentration ends. While this size, you gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity(Stealth) checks and a +5 bonus to AC, you can move through gaps up to 1 inch across without squeezing, and you can't make weapon attacks.</p>
