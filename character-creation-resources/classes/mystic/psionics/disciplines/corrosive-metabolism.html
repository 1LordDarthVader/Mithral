    <h1>Corrosive Metabolism</h1>
    



<p>Your control over your body allows you to deliver acid or poison attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Psychic Focus.</strong> While focused on this discipline, you have resistance to acid and poison damage.</p>
<p><strong>Corrosive Touch (1-7 psi).</strong> As an action, you deliver a touch of acid to a creature within your reach. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 acid damage per psi point spent on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong>Venom Strike (1-7 psi).</strong> As an action, you create a poison spray that targets one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 poison damage per psi point spent and is poisoned until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.</p>
<p><strong>Acid Spray (2 psi).</strong> As a reaction when you take piercing or slashing damage, you cause acid to spray from your wound; each creature within 5 feet of you takes 2d6 acid damage.</p>
<p><strong>Breath of the Black Dragon (5 psi).</strong> You exhale a wave of acid in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. You can increase the damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on it.</p>
<p><strong>Breath of the Green Dragon (7 psi).</strong> You exhale a cloud of poison in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
