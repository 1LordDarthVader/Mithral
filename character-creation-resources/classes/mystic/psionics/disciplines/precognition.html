    <h1>Precognition</h1>
    



<p>By analyzing information around you, from subtle hints to seemingly disconnected facts, you learn to weave a string of probabilities in an instant that gives you extraordinary insights.</p>
<p><strong>Psychic Focus.</strong> While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on initiative rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Precognitive Hunch (2 psi; concentration, up to 1 minute).</strong> As a bonus action, you open yourself to receive momentary insights that improve your odds of success; until your concentration ends, whenever you make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you roll a d4 and add it to the total.</p>
<p><strong>All-Around Sight (3 psi).</strong> In response to an attack hitting you, you use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that attack roll, possibly causing it to miss.</p>
<p><strong>Danger Sense (5 psi; concentration, up to 8 hours).</strong> As an action, you create a psychic model of reality in your mind and set it to show you a few seconds into the future. Until your concentration ends, you can't be surprised, attack rolls against you can't gain advantage, and you gain a +10 bonus to initiative.</p>
<p><strong>Victory Before Battle (7 psi).</strong> When you roll initiative, you can use this ability to grant yourself and up to five creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you a +10 bonus to initiative.</p>
