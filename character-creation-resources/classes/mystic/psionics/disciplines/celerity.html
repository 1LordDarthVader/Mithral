    <h1>Celerity</h1>
    



<p>You channel psionic power into your body, honing your reflexes and agility to an incredible degree. The world seems to slow down while you continue to move as normal.</p>
<p><strong>Psychic Focus.</strong> While focused on this discipline, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Rapid Step (1-7 psi).</strong> As a bonus action, you increase your walking speed by 10 feet per psi point spent until the end of the current turn. If you have a climbing or swimming speed, this increase applies to that speed as well.</p>
<p><strong>Agile Defense (2 psi).</strong> As a bonus action, you take the Dodge action.</p>
<p><strong>Blur of Motion (2 psi).</strong> As an action, you cause yourself to be invisible during any of your movement during the current turn.</p>
<p><strong>Surge of Speed (2 psi).</strong> As a bonus action, you gain two benefits until the end of the current turn: you don't provoke opportunity attacks, and you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.</p>
<p><strong>Surge of Action (5 psi).</strong> As a bonus action, you can Dash or make one weapon attack.</p>
