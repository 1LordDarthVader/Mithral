    <h1>Crown of Despair</h1>
    



<p>You have learned to harvest seeds of despair in a creature’s psyche, wracking it with self-doubt and inaction.</p>
<p><strong>Psychic Focus.</strong> While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</p>
<p><strong>Crowned in Sorrow (1–7 psi).</strong> As an action, one creature you can see within 60 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d8 psychic damage per psi point spent, and it can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</p>
<p><strong>Call to Inaction (2 psi; concentration, up to 10 minutes).</strong> If you spend 1 minute conversing with a creature, you can attempt to seed it with overwhelming ennui. At the end of the minute, you can use an action to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed. On a failed save, it sits and is incapacitated until your concentration ends. This effect immediately ends if the target or any ally it can see is attacked or takes damage. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected and has no inkling of your attempt to bend its will.</p>
<p><strong>Visions of Despair (3 psi).</strong> As an action, you force one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. You can increase the damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on it.</p>
<p><strong>Dolorous Mind (5 psi; concentration, up to 1 minute).</strong> As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. It must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or it is incapacitated and has a speed of 0 until your concentration ends. It can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
