    <h1>Psychic Assault</h1>
    



<p>You wield your mind like a weapon, unleashing salvos of psionic energy.</p>
<p><strong>Psychic Focus.</strong> While focused on this discipline, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with psionic talents that deal psychic damage.</p>
<p><strong>Psionic Blast (1-7 psi).</strong> As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target takes 1d8 psychic damage per psi point spent on this ability.</p>
<p><strong>Ego Whip (3 psi).</strong> As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 psychic damage, and it is filled with self-doubt, leaving it able to use its action on its next turn only to take the Dodge, Disengage, or Hide action. On a successful saving throw, it takes half as much damage.</p>
<p><strong>Id Insinuation (5 psi).</strong> As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d8 psychic damage, and it goes into a fury, as its id runs rampant. On its next turn, it can use its action only to take the Dodge or Attack action. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</p>
<p><strong>Psychic Blast (6 psi).</strong> As an action, you unleash devastating psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 8d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can increase the damage by 2d8 if you spend 1 more psi point on this ability.</p>
<p><strong>Psychic Crush (7 psi).</strong> As an action, you create a 20-foot cube of psychic energy within 120 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 8d8 psychic damage and is stunned until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</p>
