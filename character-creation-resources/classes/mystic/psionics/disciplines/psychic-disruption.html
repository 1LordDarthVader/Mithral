    <h1>Psychic Disruption</h1>
    



<p>You create psychic static that disrupts other creatures’ ability to think clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Psychic Focus.</strong> While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks.</p>
<p><strong>Distracting Haze (1–7 psi; concentration, up to 1 minute).</strong> As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d10 psychic damage per psi point spent and can’t see anything more than 10 feet from it until your concentration ends. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</p>
<p><strong>Daze (3 psi).</strong> As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is incapacitated until the end of your next turn or until it takes any damage.</p>
<p><strong>Mind Storm (5 psi).</strong> As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 6d8 psychic damage and suffers disadvantage on all saving throws until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. You can increase the damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on this ability.</p>
