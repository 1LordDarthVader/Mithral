    <h1>Mantle of Joy</h1>
    



<p>You tap into the joy within you, radiating it outward in soothing, psychic energy that brings hope and comfort to creatures around you.</p>
<p><strong>Psychic Focus.</strong> While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks.</p>
<p><strong>Soothing Presence (1–7 psi).</strong> As a bonus action, choose up to three creatures you can see within 60 feet of you. Each target gains 3 temporary hit points per psi point spent on this effect.</p>
<p><strong>Comforting Aura (2 psi; concentration, up to 1 minute).</strong> As a bonus action, choose up to three allies you can see (you can choose yourself in place of one of the allies). Until your concentration ends, each target can roll a d4 when making a saving throw and add the number rolled to the total.</p>
<p><strong>Aura of Jubilation (3 psi; concentration, up to 1 minute).</strong> As a bonus action, you radiate a distracting mirth until your concentration ends. Each creature within 60 feet of you that can see you suffers disadvantage on any checks using the Perception and Investigation skills.</p>
<p><strong>Beacon of Recovery (5 psi).</strong> As a bonus action, you and up to five allies you can see within 60 feet of you can immediately make saving throws against every effect they're suffering that allows a save at the start or end of their turns.</p>
