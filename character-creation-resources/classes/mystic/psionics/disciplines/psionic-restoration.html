    <h1>Psionic Restoration</h1>
    



<p>You wield psionic energy to cure wounds and restore health to yourself and others.</p>
<p><strong>Psychic Focus.</strong> While focused on this discipline, you can use a bonus action to touch a creature that has 0 hit points and stabilize it.</p>
<p><strong>Mend Wounds (1–7 psi).</strong> As an action, you can spend psi points to restore hit points to one creature you touch. The creature regains 1d8 hit points per psi point spent.</p>
<p><strong>Restore Health (3 psi).</strong> As an action, you touch one creature and remove one of the following conditions from it: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. Alternatively, you remove one disease from the creature.</p>
<p><strong>Restore Life (5 psi).</strong> As an action, you touch one creature that has died within the last minute. The creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This ability can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore a creature missing any vital body parts.</p>
<p><strong>Restore Vigor (7 psi).</strong> As an action, you can touch one creature and choose one of the following: remove any reductions to one of its ability scores, remove one effect that reduces its hit point maximum, or reduce its exhaustion level by one.</p>
