        <h1>Order of the Awakened</h1>
        Mystics dedicated to the Order of the Awakened seek to unlock the full potential of the mind. By transcending the physical, the Awakened hope to attain a state of being focused on pure intellect and mental energy.<br><br>
The Awakened are skilled at bending minds and unleashing devastating psionic attacks, and they can read the secrets of the world through psionic energy. Awakened mystics who take to adventuring excel at unraveling mysteries, solving puzzles, and defeating monsters by turning them into unwilling pawns.
<h2>Bonus Disciplines</h2>
At 1st level, you learn two additional Psionic Disciplines of your choice. They must be chosen from among the Awakened disciplines.
<h2>Awakened Talent</h2>
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, and Persuasion.
<h2>Psionic Investigation</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your mind to read the psionic imprint left on an object. If you hold an object and concentrate on it for 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a psionic discipline), you learn a few basic facts about it. You gain a mental image from the object's point of view, showing the last creature to hold the object within the past 24 hours.<br><br>
You also learn of any events that have occurred within 20 feet of the object within the past hour. The events you perceive unfold from the object's perspective. You see and hear such events as if you were there, but can't use other senses.<br><br>
Additionally, you can embed an intangible psionic sensor within the object. For the next 24 hours, you can use an action to learn the object's location relative to you (its distance and direction) and to look at the object's surroundings from its point of view as if you were there. This perception lasts until the start of your next turn.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Psionic Surge</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can overload your psychic focus to batter down an opponent's defenses. You can impose disadvantage on a target's saving throw against a discipline or talent you use, but at the cost of using your psychic focus. Your psychic focus immediately ends if it's active, and you can't use it until you finish a short or long rest.<br><br>
You can't use this feature if you can't use your psychic focus.
<h2>Spectral Form</h2>
At 14th level, you gain the ability to become a ghostly figure of psionic energy. As an action, you can transform into a transparent, ghostly version of yourself. While in this form, you have resistance to all damage, move at half speed, and can pass through objects and creatures while moving but can't willingly end your movement in their spaces. The form lasts for 10 minutes or until you use an action to end it.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
