        <h1>Order of the Avatar</h1>
        Mystics of the Order of the Avatar delve into the world of emotion, mastering their inner life to such an extent that they can manipulate and amplify the emotions of others with the same ease that an artist shapes clay. Known as Avatars, these mystics vary from tyrants to inspiring leaders who are loved by their followers.<br><br>
Avatars can bring out extreme emotions in the people around them. For their allies, they can lend hope, ferocity, and courage, transforming a fighting band into a deadly, unified force. For their enemies, they bring fear, disgust, and trepidation that can make even the most hardened veteran act like a shaky rookie.
<h2>Bonus Disciplines</h2>
At 1st level, you learn two additional Psionic Disciplines of your choice. They must be chosen from among the Avatar disciplines.
<h2>Armor Training</h2>
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and shields.
<h2>Avatar of Battle</h2>
