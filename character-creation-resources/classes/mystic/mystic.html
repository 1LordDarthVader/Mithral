<h1>Mystic</h1>
Mystics shun the world to turn their eyes inward, mastering the full potential of their minds and exploring their psyches before turning to face the world. Mystics are incredibly rare, and most prefer to keep the nature of their abilities secret. Using their inner, psychic strength, they can read minds, fade into invisibility, transform their bodies into living iron, and seize control of the physical world and bend it to their will.

    <li>(a) a simple weapon or (b) a martial weapon (if proficient)</li>
    <li>(a) leather armor or (b) scale mail (if proficient)</li>
    <li>an equipment pack</li>
</ul>
<h3>Psionics</h3>
As a student of psionics, you can master and use psionic talents and disciplines. Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from spellcasting.
<h4>Psionic Talents</h4>
A <a href="./psionics/talents/talent-list.html">psionic talent</a> is a minor psionic effect you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels. The Talents Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of talents you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new talent. You chose your talents from the psionic talents list.
<h4>Psionic Disciplines</h4>
A <a href="./psionics/disciplines/discipline-list.html">psionic discipline</a> is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a mystic to manifest psionic power. A mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time, and choses them from the psionic disciplines list.
<br><br>
At 1st level, you know one psionic discipline of your choice. The Disciplines Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of disciplines you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new discipline. In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice.
<h4>Psi Points</h4>
You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points.
<br><br>
The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Mystic table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can't go below 0 or over your maximum.
<h4>Psi Limit</h4>
Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Mystic table. For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi point son a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have.
<h4>Psychic Focus</h4>
You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline's description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.
<h4>Psionic Ability</h4>
Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines.
<br><br>
<strong>Discipline save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br/>
<strong>Discipline attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
<h3>Mystic Order</h3>
At 1st level, you choose a Mystic Order. Each order specializes in a specific approach to psionics. Your order gives you features when you choose it at 1st level and additional features at 3rd, 6th, and 14th level.

<ul>
<li><a href="./subclasses/order-of-the-avatar.html">Order of the Avatar</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/order-of-the-awakened.html">Order of the Awakened</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/order-of-the-immortal.html">Order of the Immortal</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/order-of-the-nomad.html">Order of the Nomad</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/order-of-the-soul-knife.html">Order of the Soul Knife</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/order-of-the-wu-jen.html">Order of the Wu Jen</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Mystical Recovery</h3>
Starting at 2nd level, you can draw vigor from the psi energy you use to power your psionic disciplines.
<br><br>
Immediately after you spend psi points on a psionic discipline, you can take a bonus action to regain hit points equal to the number of psi points you spent.
<h3>Telepathy</h3>
At 2nd level, your mind awakens to the ability to communicate via telepathy. You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 120 feet of you in this manner. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself.
<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th,16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
<h3>Strength of Mind</h3>
Even the simplest psionic technique requires a deep understanding of how psionic energy can augment mind and body. This understanding allows you to alter your defenses to better deal with threats.
<br><br>
Starting at 4th level, you can replace your proficiency in Wisdom saving throws whenever you finish a short or long rest. To do so, choose Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma. You gain proficiency in saves using that ability, instead of Wisdom. This change lasts until you finish your next short or long rest.
<h3>Psionic Versatility</h3>
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one psionic talent you learned from this class's Psionics feature with another talent from the psionic talents list.
<h3>Potent Psionics</h3>
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon attacks with psychic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to that target. When you reach 14th level, this extra damage increases to 2d8.
<br><br>
In addition, you add your Intelligence modifier to any damage roll you make for a psionic talent.
<h3>Consumptive Power</h3>
At 10th level, you gain the ability to sacrifice your physical durability in exchange for psionic power. When activating a psionic discipline, you can pay its psi point cost with your hit points, instead of using any psi points. Your current hit points and hit point maximum are both reduced by the number of hit points you spend. This reduction can't be lessened in any way, and the reduction to your hit point maximum lasts until you finish a long rest.
<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
<h3>Psionic Mastery</h3>
Beginning at 11th level, your mastery of psionic energy allows you to push your mind beyond its normal limits. As an action, you gain 9 special psi points that you can spend only on disciplines that require an action or a bonus action to use. You can use all 9 points on one discipline, or you can spread them across multiple disciplines. You can't also spend your normal psi points on these disciplines; you can spend only the special points gained from this feature. When you finish a long rest, you lose any of these special points that you haven't spent.
<br><br>
If more than one of the disciplines you activate with these points require concentration, you can concentrate on all of them. Activating one of them ends any effect you were already concentrating on, and if you begin concentrating on an effect that doesn't use these special points, the disciplines end that you're concentrating on.
<br><br>
At 15th level, the pool of psi points you gain from this feature increases to 11.
<br><br>
You have one use of this feature, and you regain any expended use of it with a long rest. You gain one additional use of this feature at 13th, 15th, and 17th level.
<h3>Psionic Body</h3>
At 20th level, your mastery of psionic power causes your mind to transcend the body. Your physical form is infused with psionic energy. You gain the following benefits:
<ul>
    <li>You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
    <li>You no longer age.</li>
    <li>You are immune to disease, poison damage, and the poisoned condition.</li>
    <li>If you die, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you discorporate with 0 hit points, instead of dying, and you fall unconscious. You and your gear disappear. You appear at a spot of your choice 1d4 days later on the plane of existence where you died, having gained the benefits of one long rest.</li>
</ul>
