<h1>Juggernaut</h1>
Juggernauts, masters of battlefield control, are warriors whose love of the battle spurs them to gain greater control over it. Using the innate magic present in all beings, juggernauts channel this energy into their weapon, often swearing oaths in order to bind the shield to them in whats known as a iron bond.

<h2>Class Features</h2>
As a juggernaut, you get the following class features.
<h3>Hit Points</h3>
<strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d12 per juggernaut level<br/>
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 12 + your Constitution modifier<br/>
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per juggernaut level after 1st
<h3>Proficiencies</h3>
<strong>Armor:</strong> All armor, shields<br/>
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons, tower shields<br/>
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Constitution<br/>
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from: Athletics, Insight, Investigation Medicine, Perception, Survival
<h3>Starting Equipment</h3>
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
<ul>
    <li>(a) a martial weapon and a shield (including tower shields) or (b) 2 martial weapons</li>
    <li>(a) a grappling hook and 50 feet of silk rope or (b) four javelins</li>
    <li>light plate and an equipment pack</li>
</ul>
<h3>Iron Bond</h3>
At 1st level, you gain the ability to form a powerful bond with your weapon. You can bond with a weapon over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You must be holding the weapon for the duration, at the conclusion of which you gain the following benefits while holding the bonded weapon.
<br><br>
Your bonded weapon is indestructible by nonmagical means, weighs nothing for you, and weighs 3 times the normal weight for other creatures.
<br><br>
You know the general direction of your bonded weapon provided it is on the same plane of existence, and you can pinpoint its exact location if you are within 30 feet of it.
<h4>Bonding With a Shield</h4>
You can also form an Iron Bond with a shield, and doing so allows you to don and doff it using your object interaction.
<h3>Battlecry</h3>
When you unlock this at 1st level, as a bonus action you can either taunt people into fighting you, or rally the spirits of your friends.
<br><br>
Once you have used your battlecry the number of times shown for your juggernaut level in the battlecry column of the juggernaut table, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use your battlecry again.
<br><br>
Your juggernaut save DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.
<br><br>
<strong>Taunt.</strong> Choose one creature within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you. The affected creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Juggernaut save DC or have disadvantage on any attack they make against anyone except you until the end of their next turn. Targets are immune to this effect if they can't see or hear you.
<br><br>
<strong>Rally.</strong> Creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you gain temporary hit points equal to your juggernaut level.
<h3>Juggernaut Specialty</h3>
At 2nd level, you gain a Juggernaut Specialty. Choose one of the following below:
<h4>Heavy Handed.</h4>
Your attacks are brutal and unexpectedly harsh. When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, the creature has disadvantage on their next attack roll.
<h4>Reckless Defense.</h4>
If you see a big hit coming in, you know how to throw it aside with all your might. The strain from this leaves you open for a counterattack, however. When a creature hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force the creature to reroll the attack roll, and it must use the new roll. When you do so, the next time a creature makes an attack against you before the start of your next turn, it has advantage on the attack roll.
<h4>Unyielding Strength.</h4>
You're strong enough to actually trust people as far as you can throw them. Shove attacks you make on your turn push creatures 10 feet. Additionally, after a creature makes a melee attack against you, you can use your reaction to make a shove attack against them, regardless if their attack hit or not.
<h3>Superior Health</h3>
When you gain this feature at 2nd level, your hit point maximum increases by 2 points, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a Juggernaut level. At 13th level, your hit point maximum increases by an additional 13 points, and it now increases by 2 every time you gain a Juggernaut level.
<h3>Juggernaut Ideal</h3>
At 3rd level you must choose an ideal to strive for. You gain an ideal feature from this path at 3rd level, 7th level, 11th level and at 15th level.

<ul>
<li><a href="./subclasses/defender-ideal.html">Defender Ideal</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/dreadnought-ideal.html">Dreadnought Ideal</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/giantslayer-ideal.html">Giantslayer Ideal</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/ravager-ideal.html">Ravager Ideal</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/sanguinaire-ideal.html">Sanguinaire Ideal</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
<h3>Juggernaut Versatility</h3>
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you change your Juggernaut Specialty, as you shift the focus of your martial practice.
<h3>Mighty Physique</h3>
At 5th level, you learn to put your mighty strength to use for offense and control. You are considered proficient in Athletics, and use double your proficiency bonus for Athletics checks. If you are already proficient in Athletics, choose another proficiency from your class list.
<h3>Extra Attack</h3>
At 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
<h3>Improved Iron Bond</h3>
Starting at 6th level you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
    <li>If your bonded weapon is within 30 feet of you, you can use your bonus action to summon it to your hand.</li>
    <li>As a bonus action, you can shunt your bonded weapon into a pocket dimension and re-summon it using a bonus action. You can only send your bonded weapon to the pocket dimension if you are holding it, and the weapon can stay in this pocket dimension forever with no ill effects on it.</li>
</ul>
Additionally, your bonded weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.
<h3>Stockade</h3>
Starting at 6th level, in combat, the area within 5 feet of you is considered difficult terrain for creatures you choose. In addition, whenever you make an opportunity attack, you can attempt to grapple or shove the creature instead of making a melee attack.
<h3>Indefatigable</h3>
Starting at 9th level, you gain a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus to all saving throws to avoid exhaustion, stage 5 of exhaustion for you now reduces your speed to 5, and you now have 7 stages of exhaustion, instead of 6. Stage 6 is now unconsciousness, and 7 is death.
<h3>Improved Grapple</h3>
At 10th level, when grappling a creature, you can drag them with you with no penalty to your movement.
<h3>Improved Shove</h3>
Starting at 13th level, whenever you successfully shove a creature, you can push it away from you as well as knock it prone.
<h3>J&#246;tungrip</h3>
At 14th level, you can wield two handed melee weapons in one hand, but you can only add half your proficiency bonus(rounded up) to attacks with them. Additionally, if you are wielding a weapon with the versatile property in one hand, you can use the two-handed die instead. If you are Small, you can now wield weapons with the heavy property in two hands with no penalty.
<h3>Improved Juggernaut Specialty</h3>
At 17th level, the specialty you chose at the beginning of your adventure has grown more powerful.
<h4>Heavy Handed.</h4>
On a critical hit, use the maximum die results on your damage dice.
<h4>Reckless Defense.</h4>
When you use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll their attack, they do so with disadvantage. If the attack still hits you, you can make a melee weapon attack against the attacker as part of the same reaction.
<h4>Unyielding Strength.</h4>
Creatures that you grapple are considered restrained.
<h3>Steeled Nerves</h3>
At 18th level, you've sustained so many wounds, you're almost numb to the big hits. Any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.
<h3>Unstoppable Force</h3>
At 20th level, as an action you can become the ultimate paragon of force, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:
<ul>
    <li>You have resistance to all damage.</li>
    <li>You are immune to being grappled, paralyzed, petrified restrained and stunned, and you can't be knocked prone.</li>
    <li>You can't be forcefully moved, your speed can't be reduced by any means, and you can walk through any creature's space.</li>
    <li>Attacks with a bonded weapon deal double damage to objects and structures.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
