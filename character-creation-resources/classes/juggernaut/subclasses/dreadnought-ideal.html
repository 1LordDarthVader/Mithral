        <h1>Dreadnought Ideal</h1>
        Some juggernauts are beaten and battered for their entire life, but this gives them an ideology of survival, that outlasting an enemy in combat is a guaranteed path to victory. The dreadnought does just that, shrugging off mighty blows endlessly until their opponent eventually tires and is dealt the killing blow.<br><br>
Consummate professionals among juggernauts, dreadnoughts never seem to let up. Even in the biggest and bloodiest battles, they and their squad are always the last ones standing.
<h2>Defensive Formation</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, all allies within 5 feet of you gain half cover, and when a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack hits, you can deal bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier to the attacker.
<h2>Bolstering Ranks</h2>
At 7th level, when you take the Help action to assist with a Charisma check, the creature you helped gains a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 10 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5)
Additionally, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion, Performance.
<h2>Grit</h2>
At 11th level, all damage except for psychic damage that you take is reduced by an amount equal to your Constitution modifier.
<h2>Resolute</h2>
At 15th level, at the start of each of your turns, if you have no more than 3 times your character level in hit points remaining, you regain hit points equal to your Constitution modifier + half your Juggernaut level (rounding down). You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.
