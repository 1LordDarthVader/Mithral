        <h1>Ravager Ideal</h1>
        The phrase: &quot;Your best defense is offense&quot; embodies this class. Ravagers are juggernauts who seek the path to defense in violence. Their goal is to end fights as quickly as possible, dealing consistent damage whether attacking or positioning their enemies.
<h2>Ruthless</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, your shove attacks deal bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier.<br><br>
Additionally, when you successfully start a grapple and at the start of each of your turns, any creature you have grappled takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier.
<h2>Determined</h2>
Starting at 7th level, little can stand in the way between you and your goals. You ignore nonmagical difficult terrain, and you gain climbing and swimming speeds equal to your walking speed. Additionally, you can move through a hostile creature's space, though you can't end your movement in an occupied space.
<h2>Oh No You Don't</h2>
Starting at 11th level, when a hostile creature successfully ends your grapple, you can use your reaction to make a grapple attack against any creature within 5 feet of you.
<h2>Relentless</h2>
At 15th level, even as your strength begins to fade, you keep fighting. Having 0 hit points doesn't knock you unconscious, but you must still make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points.
