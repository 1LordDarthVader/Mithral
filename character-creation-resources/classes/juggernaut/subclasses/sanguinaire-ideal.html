        <h1>Sanguinaire Ideal</h1>
        Sanguinaires tend to be unlucky adventurers who were bitten by a vampire to gain life-draining power. These juggernauts are usually thralls for more powerful vampire lords, but some though, through research, planning, or good(or bad) luck, stumbled upon similar powers.<br><br>
No matter how they came across the power, they are fierce, intimidating, and despite all the injuries they face, they seem to sow themselves back together in front of your very eyes.
<h2>Draining Strikes</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, your attacks gain a life draining aura. Once per turn when you hit a living creature with a melee weapon attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier, and the creature's hit point maximum is reduced by the same amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.<br><br>
Additionally, at 7th level, you can use a bonus action convert an amount of temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier into hit points, and at 15th level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, the amount of temporary hit points you gain from this feature increases to twice your Constitution modifier, and the amount of temporary hit points you can convert to hit points increases to twice your Constitution modifier.
<h2>Bloodsense</h2>
At 7th level, you have advantage on any checks to see through an illusory disguise within 10 feet of you, and on all checks to find the location of living humanoids that involve scent or blood.<br><br>
Additionally, if there is a living humanoid within 10 feet of you, you know their location.
<h2>Supernatural Charm</h2>
Starting at 11th level, as an action you can target one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. If the target can see you, they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you. The charmed target regards you as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under your control, it takes your requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.<br><br>
If you or your companions harm the charmed target, the effect ends. Otherwise, the effect lasts 1 minute or until you are unconscious, are on a different plane of existence than the target, or take a bonus action to end the effect.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Misty Escape</h2>
At 15th level, if you drop to 0 hit points, you can instead drop to 1 hit point and immediately be under the effects of the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=327">Gaseous Form</a> spell for 1 minute.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
