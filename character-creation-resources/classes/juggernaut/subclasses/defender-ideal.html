        <h1>Defender Ideal</h1>
        Defenders are juggernauts that seek to protect and heal those around them. Whether they are on the front lines holding back the enemy, or sticking in the back keeping a wizard or archer safe, they are welcome additions to any team for taking and dealing damage.
<h2>Health Sacrifice</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as an action, you can sacrifice a small portion of yourself to heal your allies or demolish your foes. You can spend an amount of Hit Dice per round equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounding down, minimum of 1).
<strong>Heal.</strong> As an action, you can touch one creature and heal them by expending some of your hit dice. Roll the dice and add your Constitution modifier to each, restoring a number of hit points equal to the total.
<strong>Harm.</strong> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend some of your hit dice to infuse your attack with a burst of radiant energy. Roll the dice and add your Constitution modifier to each, dealing extra radiant damage equal to the total, in addition to the weapon's damage.
<h2>Shelter</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you can make Medicine checks as a bonus action on your turn, and you gain proficiency in Medicine. If you are already proficient in this skill, you can choose to be proficient in one of the following skills: Intimidation, Insight, Perception or Survival.<br><br>
Additionally, you have advantage on checks to diagnose diseases and other medical conditions or to identify a creature's wounds or cause of death.
<h2>Bastion</h2>
Starting at 11th level, while holding your bonded weapon, you can use your action to create an impenetrable dome of force in a 15-foot radius around you, and lasts until the end of your next turn.<br><br>
When you create the dome, choose any number of willing creatures you can see within 120 feet of you. Each creature teleports to an unoccupied space of its choice inside the dome and can move through the dome freely, including yourself.<br><br>
A hostile creature that is in the dome's area when you create it is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space and must make a Constitution saving throw against your juggernaut save DC or take 2d8 force damage.<br><br>
The dome prevents hostile creatures from passing or reaching through it and it prevents their spells and attacks made with ranged or reach weapons from entering it. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Hospice</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you gain the power to bring someone back if they've died recently. You can cast the Revivify spell once per long rest.
