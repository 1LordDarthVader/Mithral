        <h1>Giantslayer Ideal</h1>
        Giantslayers focus all of their strength and skill with weapons into single powerful strikes meant to cripple the largest of foes. With their size and bulk they can effectively grapple, pin, and submit far larger opponents. They prize themselves on their unique tactics to fight these monsters and their resistance to their attacks, while striking back with equal ferocity.
<h2>Enlarge</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you have the ability to grow to an immense size to fight your enemies. You can use a bonus action to gain the following benefits for one minute:
<ul>
<li>Your size doubles in all dimensions, and your weight is multiplied by eight.</li>
<li>Your size increases by one category. If you were Small, now you are Medium. If you were Medium, now you are Large.</li>
<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
<li>Your weapons also grow to match your new size. While these weapons are enlarged, you deal 1d4 extra damage when you make melee weapon attacks with them.</li>
<li>Everything you are wearing and carrying changes size with you. Any item dropped returns to normal size at once.</li>
</ul>
If there isn't enough room for you to double in size, you attain the maximum possible size in the space available.<br><br>
This effect can not be counterspelled or dispelled.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Mountainous Frame</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you've enlarged yourself so much, that some of the growth has stuck around even after you shrink to normal size. when you gain this feature, roll 3d4. You grow a number of inches in height equal to the roll.<br><br>
In addition, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
<h2>Titanic Strike</h2>
Starting at 11th level, you merrily crush your opponents to dust. When you take the Attack action, you can choose to forgo any extra attacks you have and make an attack with disadvantage. If you hit, the attack is a critical hit. You can't use this feature if you already have disadvantage on your attack roll.
<h2>Titan-Sized</h2>
At 15th level, you can use a bonus action to consume two uses of Enlarge, instead of one, to grow even larger. You can also use a bonus action consume an extra use of Enlarge if you are already Enlarged. While you are Titan-sized, you gain the following benefits in place of the Enlarge feature's benefits:
<ul>
<li>Your normal size quadruples in all dimensions, and your weight is multiplied by sixty four.</li>
<li>Your size increases by two categories of your original. If you were Small, now you are Large. If you were Medium, now you are Huge.</li>
<li>Your weapons also grow to match your new size. While these weapons are titan-sized, you deal 2d4 extra damage when you make melee weapon attacks with them.</li>
</ul>
