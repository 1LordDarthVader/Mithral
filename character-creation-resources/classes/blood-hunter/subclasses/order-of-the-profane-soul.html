        <h1>Order of the Profane Soul</h1>
                        

Those who have taken to the Order of the Profane Soul have seen the limits of hemocraft against some of the most ancient and cruel fiends and terrors of the world. Unable to pursue beings of such power, creatures able to vanish amongst the nobles without a trace, or bend the mind of the most stalwart warrior with but a glance, this order trusted in their resilience and delved into this same well of corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts with lesser evils to better combat the greater. While they may have traded a part of themselves, members of this order believe the power gained far outweighs the price, for even devils now quake when they know they've drawn the attention of the Order of the Profane Soul.

<h2>Otherworldly Patron</h2>
When you reach 3rd level, you strike a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each detailed in the Player's Handbook, the Undying within the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, and the Celestial or Hexblade in Xanathar's Guide to Everything. Your choice augments some of your order features.
<h2>Pact Magic</h2>
When you reach 3rd level, you can augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast spells. You use the warlock spell list for your spellcasting.
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
        You learn two cantrips of your choice from the <a href="../../../spells/classes/warlock.html">warlock spell list</a>. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.
<h3>Spell Slots</h3>
The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
<h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.
The Spells Known column of the Profane Soul table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class and order, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
Your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells is the same as your Hunter's Bane ability score, so you use your Hunter's Bane ability score whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Hunter's Bane ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
<br><br>
        <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Hunter's Bane ability score modifier.<br>
<strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Hunter's Bane ability score modifier.
<h2>Rite Focus</h2>
Beginning at 3rd level, your weapon becomes a core to your pact with your chosen dark patron. While you have an active Crimson Rite, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells, and you gain a specific benefit based on your chosen pact (outlined below). In addition, your appearance changes to reflect some aspect of your patron while you have any crimson rite active.
<strong>The Archfey.</strong> When you deal rite damage to a creature, it glows with faint light until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the creature can't benefit from half cover, three-quarters cover, or being invisible.
<strong>The Archmage.</strong> When you take force damage, you can use your reaction to halve that damage.
<strong>The Celestial.</strong> You can expend a use of your Blood Maledict feature as a bonus action to heal one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. They regain a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft damage die + your Hunter's Bane ability score modifier (minimum of 1).
<strong>The Crimson Malefact.</strong> Once per turn when you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, that creature has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks until the start of your next turn.
<strong>The Dungeon Master.</strong> When you roll a 1 on a d20, you can expend a use of your Blood Maledict feature to reroll it.
<strong>The Elder Tome.</strong> Once per turn when you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you can learn the creature's damage vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities.
<strong>The Enterprise.</strong> Whenever you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points using a weapon, you gain a number of gold pieces equal to one roll of your hemocraft die.
<strong>The Fathomless.</strong> You can breathe underwater. Additionally, once per turn when you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, you can reduce that creature's speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
<strong>The Fiend.</strong> When you hit a creature with your Rite of the Flame, if you roll a 1 or 2 on your hemocraft die, you can reroll the die and choose which roll to use.
<strong>The Genie.</strong> As a bonus action, you expend a use of your Blood Maledict feature to give yourself a flying speed of 30 feet, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hunter's Bane ability modifier (minimum of 1 round).
<strong>The Great Old One.</strong> When you score a critical hit against a creature while using the weapon, that creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
<strong>The Great Ooze.</strong> When you hit a creature with your Rite of the Vitriol, if you roll a 1 or 2 on your hemocraft die, you can reroll the die and choose which roll to use.
<strong>The Hexblade.</strong> Whenever you target a creature with a blood curse, your next attack against the cursed creature deals additional damage equal to your proficiency modifier.
<strong>The Hopeweaver.</strong> As a bonus action, you expend a user of your Blood Maledict feature to allow one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you to immediately make a saving throw against an effect causing them to be charmed or frightened. The creature adds a roll of your hemocraft die to their saving throw.
<strong>The Lore Master.</strong> When you or a creature within 30 feet of you is forced to make a saving throw against a spell or other magical effect, you can use your reaction to expend a user of your Blood Maledict and allow the target to add add a roll of your hemocraft die to their saving throw.
<strong>The Machine.</strong> When you take poison damage, you can use your reaction to halve that damage.
<strong>The Pale Legion.</strong> Once per turn when you damage a creature with a weapon for which you have an active crimson rite, that creature has disadvantage on weapon attacks that use Strength until the start of your next turn.
<strong>The Raven Queen.</strong> When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you rolls a death saving throw, they add a roll of your hemocraft die to the total.
<strong>The Saint.</strong> When you take radiant damage, you can use you reaction to halve that damage.
<strong>The Seeker.</strong> When a creature ends its turn within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to expend a use of your Blood Maledict feature to deal radiant damage to them equal to a roll of your hemocraft die plus your Hunter's Bane ability modifier (minimum of 1).
<strong>The Sovereign.</strong> Whenever you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points using a weapon, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die.
<strong>The Stormbringer.</strong> When you hit a creature with your Rite of the Storm, if you roll a 1 or 2 on your hemocraft die, you can reroll the die and choose which roll to use.
<strong>The Symbiont.</strong> When you hit a creature with your Rite of the Toxin, if you roll a 1 or 2 on your hemocraft die, you can reroll the die and choose which roll to use.
<strong>The Undead.</strong> When you take necrotic damage, you can use your reaction to halve that damage.
<strong>The Undying.</strong> Whenever you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points using a weapon, you regain a number of hit points equal to one roll of your hemocraft die.
<h2>Mystic Frenzy</h2>
Starting at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can immediately make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
<h2>Revealed Arcana</h2>
At 7th level, your dark patron grants you the rare use of a dangerous arcane spell based on your pact. You can cast a spell determined by your patron once using a pact magic spell slot, and can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

<h2>Unsealed Arcana</h2>
At 15th level, your patron grants you the rare use of an additional arcane spell based on your pact. You can cast a spell determined by your patron once using a pact magic spell slot, and can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

<h2>Blood Curse of the Souleater</h2>
Starting at 18th level, you've learned to siphon the soul from your fallen prey. You gain the Blood Curse of the Souleater for your Blood Maledict feature. This does not count against your number of blood curses known.
