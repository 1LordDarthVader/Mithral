<h1>Order of the Lycan</h1>
Of the many terrible curses that plague the realm, few are as ancient or as feared as Lycanthropy. Passed through blood, this affliction seeds a host with the savage strength and hunger for violence of a wicked beast. The Order of the Lycan is a proud order of blood hunters who undergo “The Taming,” a ceremonial inflicting of lycanthropy from a senior member. These hunters then use their abilities to harness the power of the monster they harbor without losing themselves to it. Through intense honing of one's own willpower, combined with the secrets of the order's blood magic rituals, members learn to control and unleash their hybrid form for short periods of time. Enhanced physical prowess, unnatural resilience, and razor sharp claws make these warriors a terrible foe to any evil that crosses their path. Yet, no training is perfect, and without care and complete focus, even the greatest of blood hunters can temporarily lose themselves to the bloodlust.

<h2>Heightened Senses</h2>
Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you begin to adopt the improved abilities of a natural predator. You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

<h2>Hybrid Transformation</h2>
Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you begin to learn to control the lycanthropic curse that now lives in your blood. As a bonus action, you can transform into your hybrid form for up to 1 hour. You can speak, use equipment, and wear armor in this form. You can revert to your normal form earlier as a bonus action. You automatically revert to your normal form if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. This feature replaces the rules for Lycanthropy within the Monster's Manual.
<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. While you are transformed, you gain the following features:
<br><br>
<strong>Feral Might.</strong> You gain a +1 to melee damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 at 11th level (+2) and 18th level (+3). You also have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
<br><br>
<strong>Resilient Hide.</strong> You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks not made with silver weapons. While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.
<br><br>
<strong>Predatory Strikes.</strong> You can apply your Crimson Rite feature to your unarmed strikes as single weapon. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolIs of your unarmed strikes. When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
<br><br>
Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 slashing damage. The damage increases to 1d8 at 11th level.
<br><br>
<strong>Bloodlust.</strong> If you begin your turn with no more than half of your maximum hit points, you must succeed on a DC 8 Wisdom saving throw or move directly towards the nearest creature to you and use the Attack action against that creature. You can choose whether or not to use your Extra Attack feature for this frenzied attack. If there is more than one possible target, roll to randomly determine the target. You then regain control for the remainder of your turn.
<br><br>
If you are under an effect that prevents you from concentrating (like the barbarian's Rage feature), you automatically fail this saving throw.

<h2>Stalker's Prowess</h2>
At 7th level, your speed increases by 10 feet. You also can add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. In addition, your hybrid form gains the Improved Predatory Strikes feature.
<br><br>
<strong>Improved Predatory Strikes.</strong> You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with your unarmed strikes. This bonus increases by 1 at 11th level (+2) and 18th level (+3). In addition, when you have an active Crimson Rite while in your hybrid form, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

<h2>Advanced Transformation</h2>
Starting at 11th level, you learn to unleash and control more of the beast within. You can use your Hybrid Transformation feature twice, regaining all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. In addition, your hybrid form gains the Lycan Regeneration feature.
<br><br>
<strong>Lycan Regeneration.</strong> At the start of each of your turns, before you roll for bloodlust, you regain hit points equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) if you have at least 1 hit point and no more than half of your hit points left.

<h2>Brand of the Voracious</h2>
At 15th level, you have advantage on your Wisdom saving throws to maintain control of your bloodlust in hybrid form. In addition, your Brand of Castigation now binds your foe to your hunter's thirst for savagery. While in your hybrid form, your attacks have advantage against a creature branded by you.

<h2>Hybrid Transformation Mastery</h2>
At 18th level, you have wrestled your inner predator and mastered it. You can use your Hybrid Transformation feature an unlimited number of times, and your hybrid form can now last indefinitely.
<br><br>
You also gain the Blood Curse of the Howl for your Blood Maledict feature. This does not count against your number of blood curses known.
