<h1>Blood Curses</h1>

<h2 id="toc0"><span>Blood Curse of the Anxious</span></h2>
<p>As a bonus action, you magnify the adrenaline in the body of a creature within 30 feet of you, making them susceptible to forceful influence. Until the end of your next turn, all creatures have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks directed at the target creature.</p>
<p><strong>Amplify.</strong> The next Wisdom saving throw the target has to make before this curse ends has disadvantage. Once you've amplified this blood curse, you must finish a long rest before you can amplify it again.</p>
<h2 id="toc1"><span>Blood Curse of Binding</span></h2>
<p>As a bonus action, you can attempt to bind a creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is no more than one size larger than you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have their speed be reduced to 0 and they can't use reactions until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Amplify.</strong> This curse lasts for 1 minute and can affect a creature regardless of their size category. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature can make another Strength saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.</p>
<h2 id="toc2"><span>Blood Curse of Bloated Agony</span></h2>
<p>As a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you to painfully swell until the end of your next turn. For the duration of this curse, the creature has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity ability checks, and suffers 1d8 necrotic damage if it makes more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.</p>
<p><strong>Amplify.</strong> This curse lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.</p>
<h2 id="toc3"><span>Blood Curse of Corrosion</span></h2>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 15th level, Order of the Mutant</em><br>
As a bonus action, a creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the curse ends.</p>
<p><strong>Amplify.</strong> The cursed creature suffers 4d6 necrotic damage, and suffers this damage again every time it fails its Constitution saving throw to end this curse at the end of its turn.</p>
<h2 id="toc4"><span>Blood Curse of the Exorcist</span></h2>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 15th level, Order of the Ghostslayer</em><br>
As a bonus action, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you that is charmed, frightened, or possessed. The target creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed.</p>
<p><strong>Amplify.</strong> The creature that charmed, frightened, or possessed the target of your curse suffers 3d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>
<h2 id="toc5"><span>Blood Curse of Exposure</span></h2>
<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet is hit with an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to temporarily weaken their resilience against it. Until the end of the turn, the target loses their resistance to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell.</p>
<p><strong>Amplify.</strong> The target instead loses invulnerability to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell, having resistance to them until the end of the turn.</p>
<h2 id="toc6"><span>Blood Curse of the Eyeless</span></h2>
<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll one hemocraft die and subtract the number rolled from the creature's attack roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature's roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll succeeds. The creature is immune if it is immune to blindness.</p>
<p><strong>Amplify.</strong> You apply this curse to all of the creature's attack rolls until the end of the turn. You roll a new hemocraft die for each affected attack.</p>
<h2 id="toc7"><span>Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet</span></h2>
<p>When a creature you can see within 30 feet drops to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to make that creature immediately make a single weapon attack against a target of your choice within its attack range.</p>
<p><strong>Amplify.</strong> You can first move the cursed creature up to half their speed, and you grant a bonus to the cursed creature's attack roll equal to your Hunter's Bane ability score modifier (minimum of 1).</p>
<h2 id="toc8"><span>Blood Curse of the Howl</span></h2>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Lycan</em><br>
As an action, you unleash a blood-curdling howl. Each creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. If they fail their saving throw by 5 or more, they are stunned while frightened in this way. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this blood curse for the next 24 hours. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by this howl.</p>
<p><strong>Amplify.</strong> The range of this curse increases to 60 feet.</p>
<h2 id="toc9"><span>Blood Curse of the Marked</span></h2>
<p>As a bonus action, you can mark a creature within 30 feet of you. Until the end of your turn, whenever you deal rite damage to the target, you deal an additional hemocraft die of rite damage.</p>
<p><strong>Amplify.</strong> The next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn has advantage.</p>
<h2 id="toc10"><span>Blood Curse of the Muddled Mind</span></h2>
<p>As a bonus action, you curse a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you that is concentrating on a spell. That creature has disadvantage on the next Constitution saving throw it must make to maintain concentration before the end of your next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Amplify.</strong> The cursed creature has disadvantage on all Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration of spells until the end of your next turn.</p>
<h2 id="toc11"><span>Blood Curse of the Souleater</span></h2>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 18th level, Order of the Profane Soul</em><br>
When a creature that isn't a construct or undead is reduced to 0 hit points within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to usher their soul to your patron in exchange for power. Until the end of your next turn, your weapon attacks have advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Amplify.</strong> In addition, you regain an expended warlock spell slot. Once you've amplified this blood curse, you must finish a long rest before you can amplify it again.</p>
