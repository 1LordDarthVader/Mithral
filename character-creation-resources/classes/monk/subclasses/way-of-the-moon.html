        <h1>Way of the Moon</h1>
        Monks of the Way of the Moon follow an ancient tradition, one in which adherents study the cycles of the moon. These monks often adorn themselves with tattoos of lunar symbols and moons, and believe that just as the moon changes form, so must they. Sometimes these monks are religious leaders or guardians of the night and all creatures that thrive within it. Other monasteries might focus on understanding the moon's effects on the world such as with madness, lycanthropy, or the shaping of the tides. Some of these monks might even be mad hermits, obsessed with the moon and basking in its glory.<br><br>
Regardless of what their primary focus is, monks of this tradition learn how to best operate in the dark, develop unique abilities inspired by the phases of the moon, and can see through darkness and illusions.
<h2>Moon Soul</h2>
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level you gain proficiency in the Nature skill if you don't already have it. You also gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.
<h2>Lunar Arts</h2>
Beginning at 3rd level you have unlocked special ki techniques that are influenced by the moon. As an action, you can spend a number of ki points to perform one of the following abilities. If the ability allows you to cast a spell, you cast it without requiring material components.
<ul>
<li><strong>Full Moon.</strong> You can spend 2 ki points to cast the moonbeam spell. This spell ends if you use any other option granted by this feature. You can spend additional ki points to cast <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=526">Moonbeam</a> at a higher level. Each additional ki point you spend increases the spell's level by 1. The maximum number of ki points that you can spend equals half your monk level.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Half Moon.</strong> You can spend 1 ki point to make one unarmed strike each against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you. When you hit a creature with one of these unarmed strikes, the attack deals radiant damage instead of the bludgeoning damage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Moon.</strong> You can spend 2 ki points to cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=442">Invisibility</a> spell. When you do so, the spell has a range of self.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Celestial Resilience</h2>
At 6th level the magic of the moon flows through you. You gain resistance to radiant damage.<br><br>
You can cause others to fall under your lunar spell. As an action, you can force creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you that can see you to succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn. Once you use this ability you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Brilliant Serenity</h2>
At 11th level your connection to the moon has made you become a calming presence to allies. When you use your Stillness of Mind feature, you can also choose to end one short- or long-term madness you are suffering from in place of the charmed or frightened conditions. Additionally, you can choose a creature within 5 feet of you that is charmed, frightened or suffering from a madness effect, ending one of those conditions on it instead of yourself.
<h2>Lunar Beam</h2>
At 17th level you can channel ki into a blast of lunar power. As an action, you can spend 4 ki points to project a beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not blinded. A blinded target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Shapechangers have disadvantage on this saving throw.<br><br>
You can increase this effect's damage by 1d8 per each additional ki point spent on it.
