        <h1>Way of the Force</h1>
        Monks of the Way of the Force harness the very power of gravity. They have meditated on this natural force to be able to tap their ki into it and alter gravitation around them. They often see gravity not only as a force of nature, but as an extension of their arts.
<h2>Gravitational Punches</h2>
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your blows are so heavy that they reform gravity around them. You gain the following benefits to your Flurry of Blows.
<ul>
<li>Whenever hit two different creatures with the unarmed strikes granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can create a gravitational pull between the two creatures. Until the end of your next turn, the creatures can't willingly move while more than 20 feet away from each other.</li>
<li>Whenever you hit the same creature with both of the unarmed strikes granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can create a vortex of high gravity within it, halving its speed until the end of your next turn.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Light as a Feather</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you gain the ability to reduce your own gravity. When you're prone, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.
<h2>Fluctuate</h2>
At 6th level you gain the following abilities:
<ul>
<li><strong>Catch.</strong> You can spend 1 ki point to cast <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=278">Feather Fall</a> without providing material components.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy Stance.</strong> As a reaction to being forcibly moved, you can increase your gravity and not be moved instead.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Low Gravity</h2>
Beginning at 11th level, when you use your Step of the Wind feature, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn.<br><br>
In addition, when you affect a creature with your Gravitational Punches feature, it takes force damage equal to your Martial Arts die.
<h2>Plummet</h2>
Beginning at 17th level, once per turn, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to attempt to change the creature's gravitational pull. If the creature is somehow anchored to the ground or other surface, this ability has no effect on it.<br><br>
Otherwise, the creature's gravity is changed and it begins to fall in any direction of your choice. The creature must make a Strength saving throw against your Ki save DC. On a failed save, the creature falls up to 60 feet in the chosen direction. On a successful save, it falls up to 30 feet in the chosen direction. In either case, if a solid object is encountered in this fall, the creature strikes it just as it would during a normal downward fall. The creature's gravity returns to normal after the fall or after it collides with anything.
