        <h1>Way of the Four Elements</h1>
        You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.<br><br>
Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.
<h2>Elemental Strikes</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, your strikes carry elemental energy with them. When you deal damage to a target with an unarmed strike, you can change the damage type to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.
<h2>Spellcasting</h2>

At 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements.
