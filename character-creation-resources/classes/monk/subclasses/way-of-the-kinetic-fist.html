        <h1>Way of the Kinetic Fist</h1>
        The way of the kinetic fist teaches that power is best accompanied by speed. Masters of this tradition are blindingly fast as they use ki to propel themselves to superhuman speeds in order land punches and kicks with the earth shattering power of their momentum.
<h2>Swift as a River</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, when you choose this tradition, you can use your step of the wind ability without expending any ki points. You can do this a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier, and regain all uses of this ability when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Plunging Iron Strikes</h2>
At 3rd level, you can move with sudden bursts of speed to put kinetic power behind your punches.<br><br>
Once per turn, you can make an unarmed attack against a creature as if you had a reach of 15 feet. However, you must move adjacent to the target of the attack if you are not adjacent to them when you make the attack. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks, and attacks you make when you move this way deal extra bludgeoning damage equal to half your monk level.
<h2>Kinetic Dive</h2>
At 6th level, you gain an alternative way to you use your Slow Fall feature. If you fall from a height of at least 30 feet, then you may choose to do a kinetic dive instead of falling slowly. When you land, you still reduce damage as normal, but each creature within 10ft of you must make a dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10ft you fell (to a maximum of 10d6) and be knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not knocked prone.<br><br>
The radius of the dive's impact increases by 10 feet and the damage die increases to a d8 if you fall from more than 100 feet.
<h2>Lightning Mind</h2>
Starting at 11th level, you have mastered the ability to slow your perceptions, causing things to move at an incredibly slow pace around, allowing you to use your speed to greater advantage. You can take up to three reactions each round instead of one. However, you must spend a ki point to perform each reaction after the first. You can only use one reaction per trigger.
<h2>Kinetic Extremes</h2>
At 17th level, you can push your body well beyond it limits to move even faster for short bursts. When you use your Falling stone strikes feature, you can choose to increase the reach of your unarmed attacks to 30 feet and to be able to make three attacks when you take the attack action.<br><br>
If you do this, you must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of your turn. On a failed save, you take one point of exhaustion. Each time you use this feature, the DC of the saving throw increases by three.
