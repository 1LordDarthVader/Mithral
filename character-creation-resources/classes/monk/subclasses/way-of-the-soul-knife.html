        <h1>Way of the Soul Knife</h1>
        Monks of the Way of the Soul Knife are monks who have learned to harnass and focus their ki, using their inner will and focus to control psionic powers - primarily into a blade of pure Psionic power: a Soul Knife.
<h2>Soul Knife</h2>
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you've learned to focus your ki into a psionic blade. As a bonus action, you can create a blade of pure scintillating psionic energy. The blade you create this way most typically takes the form of a knife-like blade projecting from your fist, but you can shape it however you choose. You can choose to create multiple blades, but any blade you are not holding vanishes at the end of your turn and must be resummoned.<br><br>
Regardless of the form it takes, the weapon is a monk weapon for you, deals 1d8 psychic damage, and has the light, finesse, and thrown (20/60) properties.
<h2>Telekinetic Force</h2>
Additionally at 3rd level, you learn the mage hand cantrip. You also gain the ability to smash a target creature or object you can see with your mental power. As an action, you can force a target within 60 feet to succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 1d10 bludgeoning damage and be knocked 5 feet in a direction of your choice or knocked prone.<br><br>
You can spend 1 Ki Point to add any of the following modifiers to this attack. The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power. The number of Ki you may spend on one attack increase as you gain levels in this class. You may spend up to 2 ki points at level 5, 3 ki points at level 9, 4 ki points at level 14, and 5 ki points at level 17.
<ul>
<li><strong>Hammering (1+ ki points).</strong> The target takes an additional 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each point spent.</li>
<li><strong>Hurling (1-3 ki points).</strong> The target is knocked an extra 10 feet in a direction of your choosing for each point spent.</li>
<li><strong>Crushing (2 ki points).</strong> The target is restrained until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Sweeping (3 ki points).</strong> You can target all creatures in a 10 foot radius of a point within range.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Art of the Soul Knife</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your expertise with the blade allows you to control it in unique and powerful ways.
<ul>
<li><strong>Extended Knife.</strong> You can expend 1 ki point to give your weapon the Reach property until the end of your turn.</li>
<li><strong>Psionic Flurry.</strong> When you make a Flurry of Blows, you can make the additional attacks with your Soul Knife.</li>
<li><strong>Soul Strike.</strong> When you take the attack action, you can focus. Make a single attack using your action (forgoing any additional attacks gained from Extra Attack) to ignore all armor a creature has and treating its AC as 10 + its dexterity. On a hit, the creature takes additional damage equal to your wisdom modifier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Power of the Mind</h2>
Starting at 11th level, your Psionic abilities manifest more completely, giving you greater control and power in your psionic abilities.
<ul>
<li><strong>Ethereal Sweep.</strong> When you use Extended Knife, you can sweep or stab through multiple creatures with a single blow. Once per turn, when you make an attack with your Soul Knife, you can make a single additional weapon attack with your Soul Knife against another creature within range.</li>
<li><strong>Consumptive Blade.</strong> Whenever you kill a creature with your Soul Knife that has an Intelligence of 6 or higher, you can can use your reaction draw in part of their Psionic essence. You regain 1d4 hit points and 1 expended ki point.</li>
<li><strong>Empowered Discipline.</strong> When you use your Discipline, you can expend 1 ki point for free without exhausting the ki point on empowering the Psionic Power granted by the Discipline (this cannot be used on the spells granted by the Discipline).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Transcendent Knife</h2>
Starting at 17th level, your Soul Knife becomes an peerless weapon. You can add a +1 to its attack and damage rolls. You can choose for your knife to effect inanimate material, causing it to gain the Siege property and deal force damage to it when you choose. Reactions that parry or block to add Armor Class against an attack are ineffective against attacks made with the Soul Knife.<br><br>
Additionally, critical strikes from your weapon rends soul of the target. If a creature would have less than 50 hit points after taking damage from your critical strike, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On failure, its Charisma becomes zero and it dies.
