<h1>Way of Pride</h1>

Monks of the Way of Pride value themselves above all others. These monks focus on mastering their form, ego, and destructive power. They use their monastic traditions publicly, with the intention of gaining the respect and admiration of “lesser beings.”

<br><br>The prideful traditions of this order include adorning oneself with jewelry, hiding their scars from prying eyes, and commanding respect from those that would oppose them.

<h2>Tall Tales</h2>
At 3rd level, you have gained a knack for telling embellished tales of your past achievements. You gain proficiency in your choice of one of the following skills: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion.

<h2>Bruised Ego</h2>
At 3rd level, your ego bolsters your vitality, strengthening as you fight to prove your vigor. Whenever you expend a ki point, you can also choose to gain temporary hit points equal to your Proficiency Bonus. While your current hit points are equal to or less than half your maximum hit points, you can also add your Wisdom modifier to the amount of temporary hit points gained.

<h2>Assertive Attacker</h2>
At 3rd level, while your current hit points are equal to or less than half your maximum hit points, you gain a bonus to the damage of your unarmed strikes equal to your proficiency bonus.

<h2>Irrational Retaliation</h2>
Beginning at 6th level, damage dealt to you is damage dealt to your pride, and that is something you simply cannot allow. Whenever a creature deals damage to you, you can use your reaction to expend 2 ki points to target that creature. Until the end of your next turn, all attacks you make against the target creature have advantage.

<h2>Redoubled Efforts</h2>
Additionally at 6th level, while your current hit points are equal to or less than half your maximum hit points, you can roll one additional Martial Arts die when determining the extra damage dealt by a critical hit.

<h2>Ever Prideful</h2>
At 11th level, your muscle memory takes over. When your hit points are reduced to 0 you are not knocked unconscious, but you must still make death saving throws and suffer all the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. At the beginning of each of your turns whilst in this state you can spend 1 ki point to remain in this state. If you do not spend a ki point at the start of your turn whilst at 0 hit points you suffer all the normal effects of being reduced to 0 hit points. The following also apply:

<ul>
    <li>You cannot speak.</li>
    <li>You cannot cast or concentrate on spells.</li>
    <li>Critical hits against you in this state count as one failed death saving throw instead of 2.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Egotistical</h2>
Beginning at 17th level, you gain the benefits of this subclass' features that state 'while your current hit points are equal to or less than half your maximum hit points' whenever you are below your hit point maximum instead, provided you have been damaged by a hostile creature within the past minute.
