        <h1>Way of the Void</h1>
        Monks that follow the traditions of the Way of the Void look to the spaces between the stars for inspiration in their techniques. Their training emphasizes emptiness of mind and body, and monks of this tradition spend long hours in fasting and meditation.
<h2>Void Techniques</h2>
At 3rd level, you learn the techniques of the void. You gain the following abilities:
<ul>
<li><strong>Vacuum Pull.</strong> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one ki point to create a vacuum centered on the target. Each creature other than you within 10 feet of the target must make a Strength saving throw or be pulled 5 feet toward the target and take bludgeoning damage equal to your Martial Arts die.</li>
<li><strong>Deflect Spell.</strong> When you take damage from a spell, you can expend one ki point and use your reaction to reduce or nullify the magic. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier + your monk level.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Empty Soul</h2>
At 6th level, you learn to fight without being weighed down by your own life energy. When you have no ki remaining, your movement speed increases by 10 feet and you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) at the start of each of your turns.
<h2>Empty Mind</h2>
At 11th level, you learn to remove your presence. You are always under the effects of a Nondetection spell. Additionally, you are immune to psychic damage.
<h2>Nothing</h2>
At 17th level, you can become so empty that not even magic can exist around you. You can use your action to spend 6 ki points to cast the Antimagic Field spell, without material components.
