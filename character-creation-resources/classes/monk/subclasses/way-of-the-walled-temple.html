<h1>Way of the Walled Temple</h1>

Within the walls of a temple, monks train to fight with only their fists and their wits.  But someone has to protect the temple while the others train, and those that do have found that a good shield is not to be discounted.  Adherents to the Way of the Walled Temple have adapted the teachings of their masters to incorporate defensive gear, and value vigilance and protection above all else.

<br><br>Because these monks almost never leave their temples, it is unusual for one to become an adventurer, and when they do it is usually because something has gone wrong.  Perhaps their temple was destroyed, and they seek retribution from those who did it.  Maybe they failed to spot an intruding assassin, and have abandoned their post in shame.  It's also possible that the monk feels confident their old temple is well guarded, and seeks a new shrine to watch over.

<h2>Temple's Shield</h2>

Starting at 3rd level, you have mastered using a shield alongside your martial arts, gaining the following benefits:

<br><br><strong>Monk's Shield</strong> You gain proficiency with shields, and wielding one does not prevent you from using your Martial Arts, Unarmored Movement, or Unarmored Defense features.  A shield is also considered a monk weapon for you.

<br><br><strong>Deflect Strikes</strong> While wielding a shield, you can expend 1 ki points to use your reaction to neutralize the force of an incoming melee weapon attack.  When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by an amount equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.  If you reduce the damage to 0, you can immediately make a shove attempt against the attacker, substituting a shield attack roll for your Strength (Athletics) check.  All other restrictions of making a shove still apply.

<br><br><strong>Ricochet Shot</strong> While wielding a shield other than a tower shield, it gains the <em>Thrown (20/60)</em> and <em>Returning</em> properties for you.

<h2>Watcher on the Wall</h2>

At 6th level, you learn a special meditation technique that expands your vision.  After spending 1 minute in meditation, you can expend 2 ki points to enter a state of heightened awareness.  For the next hour, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and initiative rolls, and you cannot be surprised.

<h2>Stoic Gatekeeper</h2>

Starting at 11th level, you can keep multiple assailants at bay.  While wielding a shield, you can take two reactions intead of one.

<h2>Last Line of Defense</h2>

Starting at 17th level, you have the power to single-handedly protect your temple.  Using an action, you can expend 6 ki points to cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=821">Wall of Force</a> spell.  When you cast the spell in this way, it does not require material components, and the wall is semi-visible, resembling the architechture of your home temple.
