<h1>Way of the Leaden Crown</h1>

In contrast to the esoteric ideals of other monastic traditions, monks of the Way of the Leaden Crown have practical aims: the self-governance of humanoid peoples. These monks see the history of the world as a series of clashes between groups of powerful beings, where humanoids were at best collateral damage and at worst disposable pawns. To break this cycle of dependence and destruction, monks of the Way of the Leaden Crown master mental powers to fight back against the otherworldly powers of the multiverse and protect humanoid sovereignty.

<br><br>One component of this plan involves training to do battle with powerful outsiders. The other equally important component is ensuring that humanoid societies are prepared to overthrow those powerful outsiders already dominating them. To that end, these monks seek political positions that place them in or near decision-making roles where they can influence humanoids to fight back against arch seraphs, arch daemons, and primordials.

<h2>Subtle Hand</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, your martial arts are enhanced by a capacity for telekinetic strikes. On your turn your reach is 10 feet when you make unarmed attacks. In addition, when you make an unarmed strike this way, it deals force damage instead.

<h2>Psionic Prowess</h2>
Also at 3rd level, your psychic powers have manifested in the ability to cast certain spells. You gain the mage hand cantrip if you don't already know it. When you cast the spell, the spectral hand is invisible.

In addition, you can cast certain spells by expending ki. You can use an action and spend 1 ki point to cast <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=201">Detect Evil and Good</a> or <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=601">Protection From Evil and Good</a>. You can also use an action and spend 2 ki points to cast <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=400">Hold Person</a>, <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=461">Levitate</a>, or <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=665">Shatter</a>. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells and you do not need to provide material components when casting them in this way.

<h2>Unsubtle Strike</h2>
At 6th level, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or monk weapon, you can force it to make a Strength saving throw against your ki save DC. On a failure, you can choose to push or pull the creature 10 feet. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until the start of your next turn.

<h2>Psychic Crush</h2>
Starting at 11th level, each time you hit a creature with an unarmed strike it gains a pressure point. A creature loses all pressure points if you give a different creature a pressure point or 1 minute after the last time it gained a pressure point. As a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to telekinetically crush a creature with 1 or more of your pressure points.

When you do, the creature must make a Strength saving throw against your ki save DC. On a failure, the creature takes 1d8 force damage per pressure point they have and they are restrained until the end of your next turn. On a success, they take half as much damage and aren't restrained. Either way, the creature then loses all pressure points.

<h2>Psionic Mastery</h2>
At 17th level, you have mastered the psionic disciplines necessary to defend mortals from outsiders. As an action, you can spend 5 ki points to cast <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=212">Dispel Evil and Good</a>, <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=399">Hold Monster</a>, <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=756">Telekinesis</a>, or <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=821">Wall of Force</a>. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells and you do not need to provide material components when casting them in this way.
