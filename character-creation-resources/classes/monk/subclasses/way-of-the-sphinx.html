        <h1>Way of the Sphinx</h1>
        Even now, millennia after their construction, the dusty tombs and forgotten crypts of the god-kings are still sacred locations. The monasteries of the sun have endured, safeguarding the tombs from harmful interlopers, with generation after generation of stalwart guardians, ensuring the pharaohs' rest is not disturbed. These monks are trained in the Way of the Sphinx, a fluid but aggressive style of martial arts, focused squarely on the use of khopeshes, and take a sacred oath to guard the tombs until their deaths. These monks leave the bounds of the desert only if one of their number has failed in their duties, and a sacred artifact from the tombs must be recovered.
<h2>Flurry of Blades</h2>
When you choose this monastic tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with khopeshes, which count as monk weapons for you. In addition, khopeshes are considered light weapons for you.<br><br>
In addition, when you engage in two-weapon fighting, you add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. When you use your Flurry of Blows feature while wielding a monk weapon in each hand, you can use your weapons for the additional attacks.
<h2>Inscrutable</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you are immune to any magical effect that would sense your emotions or read your thoughts. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain your intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.
<h2>Divine Guardian</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your monastery teaches divine magic. Some of the spells they practice hamper their enemies, others help the caster survive in their harsh surroundings. You can spend ki points to cast the Shield of Faith spells.<br><br>
When you cast a spell in this way, you must expend a number of ki points equal to the spell's level. If the spell can be cast at higher levels, you can spend additional ki points to cast the spell at a higher level, at a cost of one additional ki point per spell level. You can expend ki points equal to no more than one third of your monk level (rounded down) on any spell granted by this feature.
<h2>Claws of the Sphinx</h2>
Also at 6th level, you are marked by the gods to defend the mortal world against the spirits of the dead and other unholy creatures. Attacks you make with a light monk weapon count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
<h2>Whirling Blades</h2>
Starting at 11th level, as an action while you hold a monk weapon in both hands, you can spend movement equal to your Unarmored Movement bonus to whirl around in a lethal flourish. When you do so, each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage equal to your Martial Arts die + your Dexterity modifier, and is pushed 5 feet away from you in a straight line. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed away from you.
<h2>Pharaoh's Judgement</h2>
Starting at 17th level, your voice booms with divine authority, causing hostile creatures to freeze when you pass judgement upon them. As an action, you can spend a number of ki points up to your Wisdom modifier. You cast the Hold Person spell, targeting a number of creatures equal to the number of ki points spent. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
