        <h1>Way of the Crimson Soul</h1>
        The way of the crimson soul teaches its practitioners to control the life force that flows within themselves and all other creatures. Masters of its teachings do not manipulate blood as much as their title would suggest; instead manipulating the positive and negative energies that give or imitate life.<br><br>
The simplicity of this school is often underestimated, as it only takes a touch from these monks in order to tear away a creature's concentration or reinforce it tenfold. The art of creating open, two-way canals is difficult to master and as such it takes only weeks for a student to understand how to steal life, but it takes years in order to do the reverse. As a necessity, the teachings of the crimson soul always include wisdom and humility as their most important lessons, as the power to steal life with a touch can become addicting to those with too much of an ego.
<h2>Siphoning Strikes</h2>
At 3rd level, when you choose this tradition, you gain the ability to heal yourself by simply striking a creature and siphoning some of its life energies. Whenever you hit a creature with an unarmed attack, you can spend a ki point to regain hit points equal to the amount you rolled on the martial arts die plus 1.<br><br>
You do not regain hit points with this ability if you target a construct an undead or a creature that has temporary hit points.
<h2>Positive/Negative Transfer</h2>
At 6th level, you you've become proficient transferring the low of life energies within yourself and giving it to creatures you touch. You can now choose to take necrotic damage in order to cast certain spells without expending a spell slot or needing spell components. These spells and the amount of necrotic damage you take when you cast them are shown below. You use your Ki save DC in place of spell save DCs.
<table>
<tr>
<th>Necrotic Damage</th>
<th>Spell</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3d8</td>
<td>Bestow Curse</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4d8</td>
<td>Life Transference (ignore this spell's damage to you)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4d8</td>
<td>Animate Dead</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5d8</td>
<td>Revivify</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Thousand-Lives Endurance</h2>
At 11th level, If you would be reduced to zero hit points, you can reduce your maximum hit points by 2d12 in order to remain standing at 1 hit point. You can do this as many times as you want, but each time you do so you roll an additional d12.<br><br>
Your maximum hit points return to normal when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Life-Scattering Palm</h2>
At 17th level, you can forcefully push the life force out a creature and use it to harm or heal other creature around it. When you hit a creature with an unarmed attack, you can spend 4 ki points to deal 4d10 necrotic damage to the target. You can then cause up to 6 creatures within 15 feet of the target to either regain half as many hitpoints or take half as much necrotic damage.
