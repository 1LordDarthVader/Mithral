        <h1>Way of the Twin Dragons</h1>
        Monks of the Twin Dragons are masters of fighting in tandem with a partner. However, their partner is a ki-based projection of themselves. This makes them dangerous to fight, and hard to keep track of, as the advantage created by their tandem style fighting means that every blind spot is struck and every opening is taken advantage of as four fists, two real, and two ethereal, strike joints nerves and weak points in a hundred different ways from a hundred different angles, pummeling an enemy into the ground.
<h2>Extended Self Technique</h2>
At 3rd level, when you choose this tradition, you summon a split, a ki projection of yourself that fights alongside you.<br><br>
On your turn, you may move your split up to your movement speed, then, if you use flurry of blows, you can have your split attack as well, dealing your martial arts die in force damage and inflicting one of the following effects on the target until the start of your next turn.
<ul>
<li>The targets movement speed is reduced by 10 feet.</li>
<li>The target has disadvantage on its next attack.</li>
<li>The target cannot use its reaction.</li>
</ul>
Your split uses your attack bonus to hit, but only deals your martial arts die in force damage. If you or an ally are not within 5 feet of the creature your split is attacking, its attack deal damage but does not have any other effect.<br><br>
The split is also an illusion and cannot take damage or be dispelled. It cannot move through objects and creatures, and cannot be more than 60 ft away from you, and is moved with you if you move more than 60 feet away from it.
<h2>Twin Ox style</h2>
At 6th level, you begin to perfect the strange style of fighting aside your self. You've learned to time your's and your split's strikes in unison. Whenever you expend a ki point to do stunning strike and your split is adjacent to the creature you are attacking, you can force the creature roll a d4 and subtract that from their saving throw roll.
<h2>Twin Spirit Style</h2>
At 11th level, you have strengthened your split's projection and connection to you. Whenever you take the attack action, you can choose to attack a target that your split is adjacent to by switching places with your split with a quick teleportation
<h2>Twin Dragon Style</h2>
At 17th level, you have mastered combat alongside your split. Whenever you end your turn, you may spend 3 ki points to have your split copy every action, bonus action, and move action you made during your turn.
