        <h1>Way of the Sun Soul</h1>
        Monks of the Way of the Sun Soul learn to channel their own life energy into searing bolts of light. They teach that meditation can unlock the ability to unleash the indomitable light shed by the soul of every living creature.
<h2>Radiant Sun Bolt</h2>
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can hurl searing bolts of magical radiance.<br><br>
You gain a new attack option that you can use, replacing any unarmed strikes. This special attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Wisdom modifier to its attack and damage rolls. It deals radiant damage equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die.<br><br>
The range of this feature increases as you gain levels, as shown below:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Monk Level</th>
<th>Range</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5th</td>
<td>40 ft</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11th</td>
<td>50 ft</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>17th</td>
<td>60 ft</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Searing Arc Strike</h2>
At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your ki into searing waves of energy. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can force creatures in a 15-foot cone to make Dexterity saving throws. Creatures that fail their saving throw take radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier. Creatures that succeed their saving throw take half as much damage.<br><br>
You can expend ki points to increase the power of this feature, to a maximum number of ki points equal to half your monk level (rounding down), increasing the damage by 1d8 and the area of effect by 5 feet per ki point expended.
<h2>Searing Sunburst</h2>
At 11th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of light that erupts into a devastating explosion. As an action, you magically create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant.<br><br>
Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take radiant damage equal to 2d6 + your Wisdom modifier. A creature doesn't need to make the save if the creature is behind total cover that is opaque.<br><br>
You can increase the sphere's damage by spending ki points. Each point you spend, up to a maximum of 3, increases the damage by 2d6.
<h2>Sun Shield</h2>
At 17th level, you become wreathed in a luminous, magical aura. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action.<br><br>
If a creature hits you with a melee attack while this light shines, you can use your reaction to deal radiant damage to the creature. The radiant damage equals 5 + your Wisdom modifier.
