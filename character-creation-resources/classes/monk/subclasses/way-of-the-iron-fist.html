        <h1>Way of the Iron Fist</h1>
        One of the oldest monastic traditions, monks of the Way of the Iron Fist focus on the deep and unyielding truths that the ages have carved into stone, to instill
Monks of the Way of the Iron Fist are taught the techniques of the unyielding mountain, harnessing it's resilience. They often train in unrelenting conditions to push their bodies beyond their normal limits. This training allows them to use their ki as a raw weapon in their punches and parries. In battle, these monks launch waves of ki energy at their foes while simultaneously bolstering their own defenses.
<h2>Mountainous Resilience</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you become resistant to the harsh conditions of the mountain. You are naturally adapted to cold climates and high altitudes.
<h2>Fist of Iron</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you may expend 1 ki point as a bonus action to surround your fists with a glowing aura of raw energy that sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. This energy lasts until you dismiss it as a bonus action, use this feature again, unleash the energy as described below, or until 1 minute has passed.<br><br>
While you have the aura, your unarmed attacks are considered magical and you can choose to deal force damage with them instead of their normal damage.<br><br>
When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike you can choose to unleash the energy. If you do so, the creature takes an extra 1d10 force damage, and the energy dissipates and the effects end. When you reach 11th level in this class, the extra force damage increases to 2d10.
<h2>Furious Strikes</h2>
Starting at 6th level, when you hit and damage a creature with both of your attacks granted by Flurry of Blows, it must make a Constitution saving throw or stagger under the heavy blows. Creatures that are immune to being stunned automatically succeed on this saving throw. A staggering creature's speed is halved, it can't take reactions, and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws until the end of your next turn.
<h2>Ki Wave</h2>
Starting at 11th level, you can punch the ground as an action and release a burst of energy that ripples outwards from you. Each creature on the ground in a 25-foot cube originating from you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 2d6 force damage and is knocked prone. Additionally, the ground in the area becomes difficult terrain to all other creatures except you until the start of your next turn.<br><br>
You can increase the damage of this feature by spending up to 3 ki points as part of the action, increasing the force damage dealt by 2d6 per ki point spent. When you spend ki points in this way, the burst of ki energizes you and you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier plus an extra 1d4 per ki point spent.
<h2>Perfect Fists</h2>
Starting at 17th level, when you use your Fist of Iron feature you may spend 2 extra ki points. If you do, your fists are enveloped in a powerful, crackling energy for 10 minutes that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.<br><br>
While this feature is active, you gain all the benefits of your Fist of Iron as well as the following additional effects:
<ul>
<li>At the start of your turn, if you have at least 1 hit point remaining, you may choose to gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.</li>
<li>When you release the energy of your fists, all other creatures, excluding yourself, within 5 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw or also take the force damage described in Fist of Iron.</li>
<li>You may use your Deflect Missiles ability to parry melee weapon attacks as well as ranged weapon attacks.</li>
</ul>
