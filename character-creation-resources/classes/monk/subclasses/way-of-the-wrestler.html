        <h1>Way of the Wrestler</h1>
        Wrestling is the ultimate contest of might, a bout where two enter a ring and only one remains within it moments later. The Way of Wrestler teaches its students to stand their ground and maintain perfect discipline and form to meet whatever challenge they face. In contrast to other monks, who are typically lithe and nimble, wrestlers are rippling with muscle, a necessity for grappling with the mightiest contenders of the sport without surrendering any ground.
<h2>Stout Defense</h2>
Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Strength modifier + your Wisdom modifier.
<h2>Implacable Stance</h2>
At 3rd level, you are considered one size larger for the purposes of grappling and have advantage on all your Strength checks.<br><br>
Additionally, if you move 5 feet or less on your turn, you can anchor your heels into the ground. Until the beginning of your next turn, you can't be moved against your will, and, for the duration, you can spend a ki point whenever you take damage to reduce the damage taken by 1d8.
<h2>Huge Presence</h2>
By 6th level, your enormous silhouette causes even hardened warriors to take pause. You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill. If you already had proficiency in this skill, you can add twice your proficiency modifier to ability checks made using it.<br><br>
Additionally, attacks made against you before you have taken a turn in combat have disadvantage.
<h2>Colossus Slam</h2>
Beginning at 11th level, you can drop your full weight on a foe like a falling meteorite. Once on each of your turns when you make a unarmed strike, you can deal twice the number of damage dice on a hit, but also knock yourself prone after the attack.
<h2>Yokozuna</h2>
By 17th level, you are a master of the art of wrestling, an unmovable titan. Whenever you take damage, you can expend any number of ki points to reduce the damage by 1d8 per ki point expended.
