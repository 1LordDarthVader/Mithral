        <h1>Way of the Outcast</h1>
        An Outcast is a monk that has lost their Way. Trained in the basics of the style, they have abandoned the rigorous discipline and philosophy of their tradition, and is usually now enrolled only in the school of hard knocks.<br><br>
Having been trained in the fundamentals of the art of ki, these monks choose as often as not to apply that art to tavern brawls. Much to the horror many more formal monks, their rough and tumble lifestyle tends to be solid source of further training.
<h2>Way of the Outcast Quirks</h2>
The following are some optional quirks for a player of this Way to choose from - these can be either preexisting, signaling their fated path toward this Way, or appear after you commit yourself to this Way.

<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Athletics skill if you don't already have it.
<h2>Pragmatism</h2>
At 3rd level, you embrace a more pragmatic view, gaining the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>You have proficiency in improvised weapons. Improvised melee weapons now count as Monk weapons for you.</li>
<li>Once per turn, when you deal damage to a prone creature, you can add 1d6 + half your Monk level (rounded down) to the damage.</li>
<li>You gain proficiency in Light armor. If your Strength is equal to or higher than your Dexterity, you can gain the benefits of Martial Arts, Unarmored Movement. In addition, while wearing light armor, you can add your Wisdom modifier to your Armor Class.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Soak it Up</h2>
At 6th level, your extensive training in the art of getting hit with bar stools and broken bottles grants you increased endurance. When you dodge with Patient Defense, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Proficiency bonus.
<h2>Where it Hurts</h2>
At 11th level, when you use Stunning Strike on a critical hit or on an attack made against an enemy that was unaware of you, the target has disadvantage on their saving throw against being stunned.
<h2>Lean Into It</h2>
At 17th level, you have thrown your fair share of walloping hits, and know how to make them reliably. You can forgo adding your Proficiency bonus to an attack to add twice your Proficiency bonus to the damage it deals.
