<h1>Dragon Knight</h1>

The bond between a knight and their dragon is nearly impossible to eclipse. Only powerful magic can even attempt to turn them against one another, and they nearly never fight each other against their own will. Despite this, a knight and their dragon are known to argue over strategy, tactics, or even miscellaneous things, as the dragon, despite its respect for its knight, is not quick to let go of its ego.

When you die, your dragon also dies after a number of hours equal to your dragon knight level. If your dragon companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of precious gems per your dragon knight level, you can call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return a dragon companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.
<br><br>
Returning your dragon to life is a grueling process, and you must expend a number of hit dice equal to half your dragon knight level (rounded up) to perform this ritual.
<br><br>
Finally, you can speak, read, and write Draconic due to the bond you and your dragon share.
<h3>Companion's Bond</h3>
Also at 1st level, your dragon gains a number of benefits because of the bond you have forged together.
<br><br>
The dragon obeys your commands as best it can. Your dragon shares your initiative, and acts on your turn. You determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on (no action required by you). If you are incapacitated, your dragon acts on its own. If you're absent, it rolls its own initiative.
<br><br>
Your dragon can't take the Attack action. It has yet to master flying and falls if it ends its turn in the air. Additionally, it can't be used as a mount or can't fly with a creature it has grappled.
<br><br>
Your dragon companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your dragon uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. While not wearing barding, your dragon companion has a natural armour class of 10 + its Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.
<br><br>
For each dragon knight level after 1st, your dragon companion gains hit points equal to 6 + its Constitution modifier, and it gains one additional hit die. The dragon's hit dice are d10s, regardless of its size. When the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws as a player would.
<br><br>
Your dragon companion also gains proficiency in two skills of your choice, and shares your saving throw proficiencies. Your dragon companion can't attune to or activate magical items.
<br><br>
Your dragon companion's level is equal to your dragon knight level for the purpose of calculating spells like polymorph and true polymorph.
<br><br>
You and your dragon always know the direction to one another, and can communicate with vague images, emotions, and feelings, regardless of distance to one another.
<br><br>
Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your dragon's abilities also improve. Your dragon can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your dragon can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Your dragon companion can't take feats.
<br><br>
Your dragon shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your dragon shares your ideal, and its bond is always "I will protect my knight; I will do the best I can for my knight; I will die for my knight."

<h3>Fighting Style</h3>
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a fighting style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
<h4>Archery</h4>
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls with ranged weapons.
<h4>Blind Fighting</h4>
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
<h4>Close-Quarters Shooter</h4>
When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.
<h4>Dual Wielding</h4>
When you take the Attack action while two-weapon fighting, you can make a single additional attack with your off-hand weapon as part of your action instead of your bonus action, adding your ability modifier to the damage of this attack.
<h4>Dueling</h4>
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with it.
<h4>Great Weapon Fighting</h4>
When you roll a 1 or 2 on the damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the damage, though you must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.
<br><br>
The weapon must have the heavy, versatile, or two-handed property to gain this benefit.
<h4>Thrown Weapon Fighting</h4>
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
<br><br>
In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
<h4>Versatile Fighting</h4>
While wielding a single versatile weapon and no shield, you can choose to wield your weapon one or two-handed until the start of your next turn. When wielding it one-handed you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and to your Armor Class. Wielding it two-handed you gain a +2 bonus to your damage rolls.
<h3>Dragon's Fury</h3>
At 2nd level, your dragon companion is ready for battle, and can now take the Attack action in combat.
<br><br>
Additionally, your dragon gains the following attack options, which it can use with the Attack action. Your dragon is proficient with them, and adds its Strength modifier to their attack and damage rolls. If an option causes a creature to make a saving throw, the save DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + the dragon's Strength modifier. Your dragon can use these attack options a number of times equal to its Strength modifier (minimum of once.) It regains any expended uses when it finishes a short or long rest.
<h4>Bite Attack</h4>
Your dragon makes a melee weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage, and an extra 1d6 damage. This extra damage increases to 2d6 at 6th level, 3d6 at 10th level, and 4d6 at 14th level. The additional damage is the same type as the one associated with your Draconic Covenant.
<h4>Tail Attack</h4>
The dragon makes a melee weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The reach of this attack increases to 10ft at 6th level, 15ft at 10th level, and 20ft at 14th level.
<h4>Wing Attack</h4>
Rather than making an attack, your dragon can beat its wings. Creatures of your choice within 5 feet of your dragon must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 5 feet away from the dragon. The range of the push and distance a creature is pushed on a failed save increase by 5 feet at 6th level, 10th level, and 14th level. Immediately after making this special attack, your dragon can move up to half its flying speed.
<h3>Dragon Knight Practice</h3>
At 3rd level, you can choose a Practice that defines your combat style. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

<ul>
<li><a href="./subclasses/elemental-practice.html">Elemental Practice</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/platinum-practice.html">Platinum Practice</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/rider-practice.html">Rider Practice</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/shadow-practice.html">Shadow Practice</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/valiant-practice.html">Valiant Practice</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Eye for Detail</h3>
Also at 3rd level, you can easily discern the value and rarity of gems, art pieces, and magical items. You can spend 1 minute studying a gem or art piece, after which you learn it's exact value. Additionally, if it is a gemstone, you learn what kind of gemstone it is. If it's an art piece, you learn how old it is.
<br><br>
Furthermore, you can cast the <a href="/spell:identify">Identify</a> spell, but only as a ritual. You don't require material components for the spell when you cast it this way.
<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
<h3>Martial Versatility</h3>
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to dragon knights. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.
<h3>Coordinated Attack</h3>
Beginning at 5th level, you and your dragon companion form a more potent fighting team. When you take the Attack action on your turn, if your dragon companion can see or hear you, it can use its reaction to make a single claw attack.
<h3>Draconic Growth</h3>
At 5th level your dragon companion's flying speed increases by 15 feet, it's other speeds increase by 10 feet, and it no longer falls to the ground if it ends its turn in the air. At 9th level it's flying speed and other speeds increase by a further 15 feet and 10 feet respectively.
<h3>Rending Strikes</h3>
Also at 5th level, the damage of your dragon's bite, claw, and tail attacks increases to 2d6. At 11th level, they increases to 3d6.
<br><br>
Additionally, your dragon companion's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
<h3>Breath Weapon</h3>
Starting at 6th level, your dragon has developed the ability to unleash raw, destructive elements from its mouth. The damage of the breath weapon, as well as its area, is determined by the color of your dragon.

As an action on its turn, the dragon can exhale this destructive energy. Each creature in the area takes 4d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one, with the saving throw calculated as follows:
<br><br>
<strong>Breath save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your dragon's Constitution modifier
<br><br>
The area of the line and cone and the damage of the breath weapon increase as you gain levels in this class, as shown below.

</tr>
</tbody></table>
Once your dragon has used this ability, it can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h3>Draconic Advancement</h3>
At 9th level, your dragon companion matures, allowing you to fight together more fluidly. Your dragon companion's size is now large, it can be used as a mount, and it is able to fly with a creature it has grappled. Additionally, as long as your dragon companion can see you, it has advantage on all saving throws.
<h3>Draconic Nature</h3>
At 11th level, you take on the physical aspects of a dragon. You gain resistance to the damage type associated with your Draconic Covenant, and you gain one of the following benefits:
<br><br>
<strong>Scales.</strong> Scales cover sections of your body, helping shield you from harm. While you aren't wearing armour, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. You can still wield a shield and get this benefit.<br>
<strong>Eyes.</strong> Your eyes become sharp and focused. You gain proficiency in the Perception and Investigation skills if you aren't already, and you have advantage on any (Wisdom) Perception or (Intelligence) Investigation checks based on sight.<br>
<strong>Tail.</strong> Your spine extends and you grow a scaled, muscular tail. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can attempt to shove a creature within 10 feet of you as a bonus action.
<h3>Titanic Roar</h3>
Starting at 13th level, your dragon can let loose a vicious roar, filling nearby creatures with dread.
<br><br>
As an action on its turn, your dragon can roar. Any number of creatures of your choice within 20 feet of the dragon must make a Wisdom saving throw against the dragon's breath weapon DC. On a failed save, creatures are frightened of the dragon for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.
<br><br>
Once your dragon has used this ability, it can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
<h3>Legacy of the Dragon</h3>
At 14th level, you have been blessed with a dragon's extended lifespan. You age only one year for every ten years that pass, and can't be aged magically.
<h3>Ancient Resistance</h3>
At 17th level, you can shrug off even the most dangerous effects. Whenever you or your dragon fail a saving throw, you can choose to turn that failure into a success.
<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
<h3>Fulfilled Covenant</h3>
At 20th level, you and your dragon share hit points, the total of which is equal to your hit point maximum + your dragon's hit point maximum. Whenever one of you takes damage, that damage is subtracted from your combined hit point maximum. When this hit point maximum hits 0, both you and your dragon fall unconscious, but only you make death saving throws. If you become stable or die, so does your dragon. If you receive any healing, both you and your dragon return to consciousness. When you spend hit dice during a short rest, you can use both your hit dice and your dragon's hit dice to restore hit points.
