        <h1>Shadow Practice</h1>
        Dragon knights who revere dark magic, or even strive to cause suffering in others, make up members of the Shadow Practice. Dark and elusive, these dragon knights use misdirection and guile to gain the upper hand in battle.
<h2>Draconic Darkness</h2>
At 3rd level, your draconic nature and that of your companion shifts to reflect the darkness you now wield. The damage type associated with your Draconic Covenant becomes necrotic, and any damage and condition immunities your dragon companion has are replaced with immunity to necrotic damage.<br><br>
Your dragon also physically shifts to reflect this change, and its scales change color to look like the darkest ebony.
<h2>Creeping Shadows</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you can move effortlessly across the battlefield, blending in with the shadows. You have a number of uses of this feature equal to your Charisma modifier, and regain all uses when you finish a long rest. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a use of it to conjure a 10-foot radius sphere at a point you can see within 30 feet of you, which becomes lightly obscured with wisps of dark energy. This sphere lasts for 1 minute, and any bright light inside the sphere becomes dim light. While inside this sphere, you and your dragon can each spend 5 feet of movement to teleport to any unoccupied space also inside a sphere. You and your dragon can each only teleport this way once per turn.<br><br>
When you summon this sphere, you can expend additional uses of this feature. Each additional use expended increases the radius of the sphere by an additional 10 feet.<br><br>
You can't have more than one sphere conjured this way at a time. If you summon a second sphere using this feature, the first sphere vanishes. If you move further than 120 feet from the sphere, it vanishes.
<h2>Withering Breath</h2>
Beginning at 7th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your dragon's Breath Weapon feature, it begins to wither for 1 minute. During that time, when it hits a creature with a weapon attack that use Strength, the damage of that attack is reduced by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier. The target can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
<h2>Night Walker</h2>
At 10th level, you and your dragon can take the Hide action as a bonus action while in dim light or in darkness. You and your dragon also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make to hide in dim light and darkness.
<h2>Shifting Shadows</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you can have up to two spheres conjured by your Creeping Shadows feature at once. If you summon a 3rd sphere, a sphere of your choice vanishes.<br><br>
Additionally, when you roll initiative and have no uses of your Creeping Shadows, you regain 1 use.
<h2>Umbra Pulse</h2>
At 18th level, your dragon can create a vortex of swirling darkness around itself as an action on your turn. Creatures of your choice within 30 feet of your dragon must make a Constitution saving throw, (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier [your choice]). On a failed save, creatures take 10d10 necrotic damage and you can choose to have them either pulled up to 15 feet towards you or pushed up to 15 feet directly away from you. On a successful saving throw, creatures take half as much damage and aren't moved.<br><br>
Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
