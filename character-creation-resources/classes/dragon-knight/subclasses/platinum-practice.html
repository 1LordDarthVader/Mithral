        <h1>Platinum Practice</h1>
        A few dragon knights worship the Platinum Dragon, Bahamut. These few are members of the Platinum Practice, and are dedicated to preserving the lives of their allies and the innocent.
<h2>Draconic Radiance</h2>
At 3rd level, your draconic nature and that of your companion shifts to reflect the holy magic you now wield. The damage type associated with your Draconic Covenant becomes radiant, and any damage and condition immunities your dragon companion has are replaced with immunity to radiant damage.<br><br>
Your dragon also physically shifts to reflect this change, and its scales change color to look like the brightest platinum.
<h2>Platinum Protector</h2>
At 3rd level, as a bonus action on your turn, you can glow with divine power; you shed bright light in a 5 foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet for 1 minute.<br><br>
Whenever you or another creature takes damage while in an area of bright light you shed, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by an amount equal to 1d6 + half your dragon knight level.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Holy Light</h2>
Beginning at 7th level, you now shed bright light in a 10 foot radius when you use your Platinum Protector feature. When you reach 15th level, the radius of the light increases to 15 feet.
<h2>Radiant Bastion</h2>
Beginning at 10th level, you're able to easily stand against the tide of battle. You and your dragon have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid being knocked prone, grappled, restrained, or otherwise moved against your will.
<h2>Divine Covenant</h2>
Starting at 15th level, when you reduce the damage a creature would take to 0 with your Platinum Protector, you can cause that creature to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice), which last for 1 minute.
<h2>Platinum Ward</h2>
At 18th level, you and your dragon embrace the true power of Bahamut, and his grace safeguards you both. You and your dragon companion gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. Additionally, whenever you or your dragon take damage that would be equal to or lower than half your dragon knight level before resistances are applied, you instead take no damage.
