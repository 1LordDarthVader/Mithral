        <h1>Elemental Practice</h1>
        Dragon knights of the Elemental Practice value the raw, destructive power of their dragons, as well as their inherent charisma, and strive to both emulate and empower this aspect of their dragons through magic.

<h2>Arcane Wellspring</h2>
When you reach 3rd level, you heighten your battle ferocity with the ability to cast spells.
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the arcane spell list. You learn an additional arcane cantrip of your choice at 10th level.
<h3>Spell Points</h3>
You have a number of spell points at a given level, as shown in the Spell Points column of the Elemental Practice Spellcasting table. In order to cast a spell, you must expend number of spell points determined by the level the spell is being cast at, as shown below:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Spell Level</th>
<th>Point Cost</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
</table>
You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.
<h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
You know two 1st-level arcane spells of your choice. Both must be from the enchantment and evocation spells on the arcane spell list.<br><br>
The Spells Known column of the Elemental Practice Spellcasting table shows when you can learn more arcane spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment and evocation spell of your choice, and must be equal to or lower than the maximum level of spells you can cast, as shown in the Max Spell Level column of the Elemental Practice Spellcasting table.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the arcane spells you know with another spell of your choice from the arcane spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or enchantment spell.
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
Constitution, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for your arcane spells, since your magic draws from the power and dominance of dragons.
<strong>Spell Save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier<br />
<strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier
<h2>Elemental Weaponry</h2>
At 3rd level, whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can imbue your weapon with elemental power until the end of your next turn. When you make an attack with an imbued weapon and hit, the target takes an additional 1d4 damage per level of the spell you cast. This damage is the damage type associated with your Draconic Covenant.
<h2>Dragon Rush</h2>
At 7th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, if your dragon companion can see you, it can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking attacks of opportunity.
<h2>Elemental Fury</h2>
Beginning at 10th level, whenever you or your dragon rolls damage of the type associated with your Draconic Covenant, you can treat any 1 you roll as a 2.
<h2>Destructive Reach</h2>
At 15th level, your elemental prowess extends outward. When you make an attack with an imbued weapon and hit, you can have up to two creatures within 10 feet of the target of the attack take half as much additional damage.
<h2>Annihilating Breath</h2>
At 18th level, when your dragon uses its Breath Weapon, you can empower it. It's area increases to a line 20 feet wide and 240 feet long if it's a line, or an 120-foot cone if it's a cone. Additionally, when you roll its damage, you can deal maximum damage instead of rolling. Finally, any damage your breath weapon deals ignores resistance to that damage.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
