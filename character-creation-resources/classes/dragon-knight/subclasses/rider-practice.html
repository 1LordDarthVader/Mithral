        <h1>Rider Practice</h1>
        The bond between a dragon knight and their dragon is strong, but those of the Rider Practice take that even further. They seek to live and to die beside their dragon, a sentiment shared by the dragon itself. While not all riders mount their dragons, those who don't are rare. Those of the Rider Practice fight in tandem with their dragon, and win in tandem with them.
<h2>Dragon's Claw</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you're able to better co-ordinate with your dragon. While both you and your dragon are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls that doesn't target you or your dragon.<br><br>
Additionally, when a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to attempt to grapple or shove the creature.
<h2>Dragon's Eye</h2>
At 3rd level, you and your dragon's keen understanding of each other allows you to better act in battle. You and your dragon can add your Charisma modifier to each of your initiative rolls.<br><br>
Additionally, if you can see your dragon, creatures that it can see don't gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being hidden from you.
<h2>Dragon's Scale</h2>
Starting at 7th level, if your dragon is within 5 feet of you, it can protect you from a creature it can see as an action. Until the start of the dragon's next turn, the creature's attack rolls against you have disadvantage. If your dragon isn't within 5 feet of you, the effect ends.<br><br>
Additionally, you can use an action to stabilize your dragon, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. When stabilized this way, your dragon will regain 1 hit point after 1d4 minutes instead of 1d4 hours.
<h2>Dragon's Wing</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you and your dragon rule the sky. Mounting and dismounting your dragon only costs 5 feet of movement instead of half your speed, you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your dragon, and neither you or your dragon take fall damage if you fall 20 feet or less.
<h2>Dragon's Fang</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you and your dragon are able to tear through your enemies. If your dragon moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a melee weapon attack in the same turn, the target takes an extra 3d4 damage.<br><br>
Additionally, your dragon can use an action to rampage and make a claw attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of it, with a separate attack roll for each target. If you're within 5 feet of your dragon when they rampage, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against each creature within your reach that was attacked by your dragon during their rampage. Your dragon can't rampage again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Dragon's Presence</h2>
Starting at 18th level, the range of Titanic Roar is increased to 120 feet, creatures that are frightened of your dragon have a speed of 0, and when you or your dragon hit a creature that is frightened of your dragon with a weapon attack, the attack is considered a critical hit.
