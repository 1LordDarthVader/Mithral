<h1>Savant</h1>

Savants are hyper-focused on their chosen area of study and often become obsessed with learning all they can about their
specialty. In their quest for discovery, savants are willing to set aside any conviction, political, religious, or
otherwise, to acquire the information they seek. To them, their desire for knowledge is more important than loyalty to
any ideology. Often at great cost, savants will continue researching until they have made an indelible mark on their
area of study.

<h2>Class Features</h2>

As a savant, you gain the following class features.

<h3>Hit Points</h3>
<strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per savant level<br>
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br>
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per savant level after 1st

<h3>Proficiencies</h3>
<strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor<br>
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, hand crossbows<br>
<strong>Tools:</strong> One set of tools of your choice<br>
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Intelligence, Wisdom<br>
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose three skills from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Persuasion, or Religion

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) two daggers</li>
    <li>one set of tools of your choice and two simple weapons</li>
    <li>leather armor and an equipment pack</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adroit Analysis</h3>
Starting at 1st level, you can quickly analyze a foe's strengths and weaknesses. As a bonus action, you can mark a creature you can see within 60 feet, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute or until you mark another creature:

<ul>
    <li>You can use Intelligence, in place of Strength or Dexterity, for your attack and damage rolls against that creature.</li>
    <li>If you hit the creature with an attack, or observe it for 1 minute, you learn one of the following characteristics of your choice: its Armor Class, movement speed, one ability score, its maximum hit points, or its creature type.</li>
    <li>You have advantage on any Intelligence or Wisdom ability checks you make to analyze the creature.</li>
</ul>
You can also use a bonus action to make an ability check using any Intelligence or Wisdom skill proficiency you have.

<h3>Perfect Recall</h3>
You can recall picture-perfect details from things you commit to memory. Starting at 1st level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing something, you can recall any information about it, at any point in the future, without requiring an ability check.
<br><br>
Examples of this may include books that you have read, a path that you have traveled, or a map that you have studied.

<h3>Unarmored Defense</h3>
Your observant way of fighting allows you to anticipate and dodge attacks. Starting at 1st level, when you are not wearing any armor or wielding a shield, your Armor Class is equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier.

<h3>Expert Student</h3>
Your ability to learn and retain new skills and languages is beyond compare. Starting at 2nd level, each time you finish
a long rest, you can choose to learn one additional language, or gain proficiency with one tool, skill, or weapon of your choice, as long as there is an example for you to learn from (such as a willing teacher with that proficiency, a manual,
or a book in a different language). You can only gain one proficiency or language from this feature per long rest.
<br><br>
You can learn a total number of additional languages and proficiencies through this feature equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 language or proficiency). When you choose to learn another language or proficiency while you are at your maximum, you must choose a language or proficiency you learned through this feature to forget, at which point you immediately lose any skill or knowledge of it.
<br><br>
When you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn a new language or proficiency at the end of each short or long rest.

<h3>Unyielding Mind</h3>
You can overexert your mind when in need of useful insights or mental fortitude. Beginning at 2nd level, when you make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ability check or saving throw, you can add 1d6 to your roll. You can add this bonus after you roll, but before you learn if you succeed or fail.
<br><br>
You can use the feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
<br><br>
This bonus increases as you gain levels in this class; at 10th level (1d8), 15th level (1d10), and 20th level (1d12).

<h3>Academic Discipline</h3>
At 3rd level, choose an Academic Discipline. Your Academic Discipline grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 13th, and 17th level in this class.

<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

<h3>Accelerated Reflexes</h3>
The speed at which you can react to stimuli is incredible. At 5th level, you gain one additional reaction you can take each round. A single effect can only trigger one of your reactions.
<br><br>
Upon reaching 17th level, your reflexes increase again, allowing you another reaction per round (for a total of 3).
<br><br>
Also, when you roll initiative, you can take the Ready action before anyone acts, so long as you are not surprised.

<h3>Potent Observation</h3>
Also at 5th level, you can highlight your foe's weak points for yourself and your allies. When you, or a creature you can see, hits the target of your Adroit Analysis with an attack, you can use your reaction to increase their attack's damage by 1d10.
<br><br>
Starting at 11th level, the bonus damage becomes 2d10.

<h3>Keen Awareness</h3>
You can react to danger at a moment's notice. Starting at 7th level, you cannot be surprised unless you are incapacitated.
<br><br>
In addition, when you roll initiative, you can expend a use of Unyielding Mind and add it result to the result of your roll.

<h3>Expert Educator</h3>
Your ability to educate others is peerless. Beginning at 9th level, when you finish a long rest, choose a number of willing creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and one tool, skill, or weapon proficiency, or one language you know. The creatures gain the proficiency or can speak and understand the language until the end of your next long rest.
<br><br>
The proficiency or language you choose to teach with this feature can be one that you've acquired from Expert Student.

<h3>Flawless Observation</h3>
Starting at 11th level, you can use Potent Observation when
a creature hits another creature you can see with a weapon attack, even if the target is not marked by Adroit Analysis.
<br><br>
Also, if you use Potent Observation to increase the damage against the creature marked by your Adroit Analysis you add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage.

<h3>Unyielding Will</h3>
It is incredibly hard for your foes to mentally dominate you. Starting at 14th level, when you fail a saving throw to resist being charmed, frightened, or stunned, you can expend a use of Unyielding Mind to automatically succeed instead.

<h3>Profound Insight</h3>
You can predict attacks before they come to pass. Starting at 18th level, any creature marked by your Adroit Analysis has disadvantage on attack rolls they make against you, and you have advantage on any saving throw they force you to make.

<h3>Undisputed Genius</h3>
Upon reaching 20th level, you realize the true genius-level potential of your mind. Your Intelligence and Wisdom scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.
