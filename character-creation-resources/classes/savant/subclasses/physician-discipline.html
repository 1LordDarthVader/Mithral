        <h1>Physician Discipline</h1>
        Physicians bring their considerable intellect to bear healing the sick and tending to the wounded. They spend their lives studying the anatomy and inner workings of mortal beings and use their knowledge to keep their allies in top condition. Using their medical training, they offer aid to those who don't have access to the luxury of divine or arcane healing magic.
<h2>Student of Medicine</h2>
When you adopt this Academic Discipline at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Medicine and herbalism kits, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with these skills. You can also use your Intelligence, in place of Wisdom, for any Medicine checks you make. If you are already proficient in either skill you gain proficiency with another skill of your choice from the savant skill list.<br><br>
In addition, if you spend at least 1 minute examining a creature, you can identify any magical or mundane disease, poison, or curse that is currently affecting that creature.
<h2>Combat Medic</h2>
You can administer aid to your allies in the midst of combat. Beginning at 3rd level, you can use an Action on your turn to use one of the following Combat Medic abilities below:
<ul>
<li><strong>Adrenaline Jolt.</strong> A creature you touch can immediately repeat a saving throw to end one of the following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, or poisoned, adding your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to their roll.</li>
<li><strong>Dress Wounds.</strong> You touch a creature and expend a use of Unyielding Mind, granting them temporary hit points equal to your Unyielding Mind die roll + your Intelligence modifier.</li>
<li><strong>Healing Surge.</strong> A creature you touch can expend one of their Hit Dice to regain hit points equal to their Hit Die roll</li>
</ul>
<h2>their Constitution modifier + your Intelligence modifier.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rending Strike.</strong> Make a weapon attack. On hit, the target takes the normal damage of your attack and its movement speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier until the start of your next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Stabilize.</strong> You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points, automatically stabilizing them. The target can then choose to expend one of their Hit Dice to regain hit points equal to the maximum value of that Hit Die + their Constitution modifier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Field Doctor</h2>
You can move across the battlefield unscathed. Starting at 6th level, when you use your action to stabilize a creature, restore hit points, or grant temporary hit points, you gain the benefits of the Dodge action until the start of your next turn.<br><br>
Additionally, when you use a Combat Medic action on your turn, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
<h2>Advanced Combat Medic</h2>
Starting at 13th level, you can perform wondrous medicinal feats. As an action, you can touch a creature and use one of the Advanced Combat Medic abilities below. You can use these abilities a combined number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<ul>
<li><strong>Regeneration.</strong> The creature regains hit points equal to four rolls of your Unyielding Mind die. If the creature has a severed body part, you can reattach it as part of this action.</li>
<li><strong>Restoration.</strong> You end one of the following conditions currently affecting it: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, a reduction to an ability score or its hit point maximum, or you reduce its level of exhaustion by 1.</li>
<li><strong>Resuscitation.</strong> If the creature has died within the last minute, you return it to life with 1 hit point. You cannot bring back a creature that died of old age, nor can you restore any body parts the creature is missing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Master Physician</h2>
Your medical knowledge is without peer. Beginning at 17th level, whenever you restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, it gains the maximum possible amount of hit points, in place of rolling.<br><br>
Also, any creature that expends a Hit Die while within 30 feet of you treats their Hit Dice as its maximum possible roll.
