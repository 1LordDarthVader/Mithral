        <h1>Archeologist Discipline</h1>
        Specializing in the study of forgotten civilizations, ancient places, and uncharted lands, Archaeologists bring the light of knowledge to the dark and deadly places of the world. Doing their best to uncover the wisdom of ages long forgotten, they tend to feel a sad kinship with the civilizations they study and go to great lengths not to destroy or offend their memory. For an Archaeologist, the best way to improve the present is to learn from both the mistakes and innovations of the past.
<h2>Student of History</h2>
When you pick this Academic Discipline at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in History and Investigation, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with these skills. If you are already proficient in either skill you gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the Savant skill list.<br><br>
Also, if you spend 1 minute examining an object you are holding, you can ascertain its value, its civilization of origin, and its approximate age. If it has any magical properties, you learn of them as if you had cast identify targeting the object.
<h2>Adventuring Academic</h2>
The places you explore have honed your survival instincts and given you special insight into the workings of ancient magic items. At 3rd level, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>You gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed.</li>
<li>You can expend a use of Unyielding Mind when you make a Dexterity ability check or saving throw.</li>
<li>You can expend a use of Expert Student to attune to a magic item that you don't meet the requirements for.</li>
<li>You can use a bonus action on your turn to use a magic item that normally takes an action to use.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Daring Determination</h2>
You are well acquainted with dangerous situations. Starting at 6th level, the target of your Adroit Analysis cannot target you with opportunity attacks. Also, when a creature targets you with an opportunity attack, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on their attack roll.<br><br>
In addition, when you are forced to make a saving throw to resist the effects of a trap, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). If a trap allows you to take only half damage on a success, you instead take no damage if you succeed, and only half damage if you fail.
<h2>Lore Master</h2>
You study every myth, legend, and folk tale you find, knowing that each story is based on a grain of truth. Starting at 13th level, if you observe a person, place, or object for at least 1 hour, you can mystically recall information about the target as if you had cast legend lore on it. The target does not need to be of legendary importance for you to gain information.<br><br>
Starting at 17th level, you only need to observe a person, place, or object for 1 minute in order to use this feature.
<h2>Master Archaeologist</h2>
Your frequent exposure to the various magical effects present in ancient places has caused you to develop an innate arcane ward. At 17th level, you gain resistance to damage from spells, magic traps, and other magical effects.
