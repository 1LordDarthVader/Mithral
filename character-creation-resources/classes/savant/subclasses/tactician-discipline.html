        <h1>Tactician Discipline</h1>
        Most successful monarchs, conquerors, and revolutions have a master strategist that is responsible for their success on the battlefield. Known as Tacticians, these intelligent leaders are always one step ahead of their enemies and strive to have a plan for every eventuality. They know the strategies that lead to glorious victory, and those that end in utter ruin. Alone, a Tactician is no threat, but with powerful allies to command, they become a formidable force, capable of toppling empires.
<h2>Student of War</h2>
When you adopt this Academic Discipline at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in History, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any History check you make. If you are already proficient in History you instead gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the savant skill list.<br><br>
You also gain proficiency with all medium armor, shields, and all martial weapons without the heavy property. When you wear light or medium armor, you can use Intelligence,<br />
in place of Dexterity, when calculating your Armor Class.
<h2>Tactical Commander</h2>
You can use your knowledge of warfare to direct your allies on the battlefield. Staring at 3rd level, you can use an action to issue one of the Orders below, targeting a creature within 60 feet, other than yourself, that can see or hear you. A single creature can only benefit from one Order at a time.
<ul>
<li><strong>Attack Order.</strong> The next time the target of this Order takes the Attack action before the start of your next turn, they can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action.</li>
<li><strong>Defensive Order.</strong> Until the beginning of your next turn, the target of this Order gains a bonus to their Armor Class equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1 Armor Class).</li>
<li><strong>Maneuvering Order.</strong> The target of this Order can use its reaction to immediately move up to its full movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</li>
</ul>
Steadfast Order. Until the beginning of your next turn, the target of this Order gains a bonus to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability checks and saving throws they make equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1)
<h2>Unwavering Resolve</h2>
Your position as a leader doesn't allow you to succumb to your base instincts. Starting at 6th level, you have advantage on saving throws to resist the effects of enchantment spells, and you are immune to the frightened condition.<br><br>
In addition, when you use your action to issue an Order, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
<h2>Strategic Genius</h2>
Your genius allows you to coordinate multiple allies. Starting at 13th level, when you use your action to issue an Order, you can issue the same Order to another creature within range.
<h2>Master Tactician</h2>
Your presence on the field of battle inspires heroic action in those who fight beside you. Beginning at 17th level, when you issue an Order, the target creature gains temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).<br><br>
Also, when you use your action to issue an Order, you can target up to three creatures in range with the same Order.
