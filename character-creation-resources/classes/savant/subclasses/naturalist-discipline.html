        <h1>Naturalist Discipline</h1>
        The Naturalist's classroom begins at the edges of civilization. They study the natural balance of ecosystems and will go to any lengths to maintain that balance. A good Naturalist is a protector of wild plants and animals, however, they will not hesitate to put down a creature that is dangerous. Experts at predicting the weather, identifying toxic and medicinal plants, and tracking animals, Naturalists make for excellent guides.
<h2>Student of Nature</h2>
When you adopt this Academic Discipline at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Nature and Survival, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with these skills. If you are already proficient in either skill you gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the Savant skill list.<br><br>
Also, at the end of each short or long rest, you can attune yourself to the surrounding environment. While attuned, you have advantage on any Intelligence or Wisdom check related to the environment's native animals, plants, or ecosystem.
<h2>Survivalist</h2>
Your knowledge of wild flora and fauna allows you to exploit their weak points when necessary. Starting at 3rd level, your weapon attacks against beasts, plants, and monstrosities score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.<br><br>
You have also learned to set traps and snares. As an action, you can expend a use of Unyielding Mind to set a hidden trap made out of natural materials in an adjacent 5-foot space. The first creature that moves into the space must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Naturalist save DC:
<strong>Naturalist save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
On a failed save, the creature is restrained. They can repeat the saving throw at the start of each turn, ending the effect on a success. A creature can detect your traps by succeeding on an Investigation check against your Naturalist save DC.
<h2>Improvise, Adapt, Overcome</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can train others to survive in the wild. At the end of each long rest, choose a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 creature). You and the creatures gain one of the following features until the end of your next long rest.
<ul>
<li><strong>Concealment Training.</strong> While in natural environments, creatures can move stealthily at a normal pace and have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks they make to hide.</li>
<li><strong>Diver Training.</strong> Creatures gain a swimming speed equal to their movement speed and can hold their breath underwater for a number of minutes equal to their Constitution modifier + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 minute).</li>
<li><strong>Endurance Training.</strong> Creatures can ignore the effects of difficult terrain imposed by natural environments and have advantage on saving throws to avoid exhaustion.</li>
<li><strong>Mountaineer Training.</strong> Creatures gain a climbing speed equal to their movement speed and they reduce any falling damage they take by an amount equal to your savant level.</li>
<li><strong>Resilience Training.</strong> Creatures have advantage on saving throws to resist the effects of extreme environments and gain resistance to either cold, fire, poison, or thunder damage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Call of the Wild</h2>
Starting at 13th level, you can tame almost any wild creature. As an action, you can force a beast, plant, or monstrosity that can hear you within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Naturalist save DC or be charmed for 1 hour.<br><br>
While charmed, the creature is friendly to you and your allies and shares your turn in combat. As a bonus action, you can issue a simple command to the creature, which it does its best to obey. Once it completes your command it will defend itself to the best of its ability until you command it again.<br><br>
Each time the creature takes damage, it can repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the charm on a success.<br><br>
You can only have one creature charmed in this way at a time. Attempting to charm a second creature ends the effect for the first. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Master Naturalist</h2>
You have become a leading authority on the natural world and can maneuver with comfort in any environment. Upon reaching 17th level, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>When you make an ability check related to your attuned environment you can treat a roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</li>
<li>You gain the benefits of all Improvise, Adapt, Overcome features.</li>
<li>Creatures with an Intelligence score of 10 or lower have disadvantage on saving throws to resist Call of the Wild.</li>
<li>The duration of Call of the Wild increases to 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
