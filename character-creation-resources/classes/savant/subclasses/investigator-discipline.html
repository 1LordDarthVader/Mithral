        <h1>Investigator Discipline</h1>
        Excelling at unraveling mysteries and uncovering secrets, Investigators possess an uncanny ability to read the intent of others. They often spend their lives working against those who deceive the innocent and take advantage of the common trust. Their considerable intellect and eye for the truth stand in the way of thieves, shapeshifters, and corrupt politicians.
<h2>Student of Truth</h2>
When you pick this Academic Discipline at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Insight and Investigation, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with these skills. If you are already proficient in either skill you gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the Savant skill list.<br><br>
Also, you have advantage on ability checks to detect illusions and shapeshifters, or if a creature is lying to you.
<h2>Rough &amp; Tumble</h2>
You have learned to fight dirty in the underbelly of civilization. Starting at 3rd level, when you hit the target of your Adroit Analysis with a weapon attack, you can expend a use of Unyielding Mind and force the target to make a Constitution saving throw against your Investigator save DC:
<strong>Investigator save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
On a failed save, the target is blinded, deafened, or silenced (your choice) for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.<br><br>
Also, when you make a weapon attack against the target of your Adroit Analysis, you can expend a use of Unyielding Mind, and add the bonus to your attack roll. You can use this feature after you roll, but before you know if you hit or miss.
<h2>Astute Defense</h2>
You have a heightened sense for danger. Starting at 6th level, when a creature you can see targets you with an attack, you can impose disadvantage on their attack roll as a reaction.<br><br>
If the triggering attack misses you, you can immediately make one weapon attack against the creature that attacked you as part of the same reaction.
<h2>Ear to the Ground</h2>
Your line of work has granted you an unfortunate familiarity with the dangerous underbelly of civilization. Beginning at 6th level, once you spend a long rest in a settlement, you have advantage on any checks you make to gather information on that settlement, its culture, factions, or important figures.
<h2>Peerless Focus</h2>
You notice even the most well-hidden details and flaws. Starting at 13th level, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>When you make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Insight) check you can treat a roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</li>
<li>You gain a bonus to any Wisdom (Perception) check you make equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</li>
<li>You automatically detect and see through illusions cast at a level equal to your Intelligence modifier or lower.</li>
<li>Once per turn, you can choose to re-roll the bonus damage from Potent Observation, but you must use the new roll.</li>
<li>If you roll initiative with no uses of Unyielding Mind remaining, you immediately regain one expended use.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Master Investigator</h2>
Your insight into the weak points of your foes allows you and your allies to exploit them with ruthless efficiency. Beginning at 17th level, when you, or a creature that you can see, hits the target of your Adroit Analysis with a weapon attack, you can use to your reaction to turn the attack into a critical hit.<br><br>
Once you use this reaction, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
