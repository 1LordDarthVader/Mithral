        <h1>School of Pathology</h1>
        Curious minds delve in the mysteries of the world, and few hold more morbid fascination than the inner workings of diseases and plagues. Those that understand the nature of disease and pathogens are precious to any society, but are at the same time, they are feared by many for what they might deal in-for some of those that delve into the mysteries of disease do so for their own dark purposes. Appearing during plagues, whether of their own making or not, the reputation of the wizards of this tradition often leaves them as scapegoats for the superstitious.
<h2>Study of Medicine</h2>
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with the Medicine skill and the Herbalism kit. You have advantage on Wisdom (Medicine) checks to identify the nature or effects of disease.
<h2>Malignant Magic</h2>
Starting at 2nd level, your magic can leave a lingering touch behind. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that causes one or more creatures to make a saving throw, you can choose to transmit a minor disease to one or more creature that failed their saving throw. Each creature you choose counts as one use of this feature.<br><br>
Roll a d4 at start of each of the affected creature's turns to determine the symptom for that turn. An affected creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the disease on a success.
<table>
<tr>
<th>d4</th>
<th>Symptom</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>The target immediately spends their reaction sneezing and coughing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>The target feels fatigued, and their movement speed is reduced by 10 ft. until the start of their next turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>The target feels dizzy and lightheaded. They have disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws until the start of their next turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>The target experiences great discomfort, suffering the effects of being poisoned until the start of their next turn.</td>
</tr>
</table>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Inoculation</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you add the Lesser Restoration spell to your spellbook, and it counts as an arcane spell for you.<br><br>
Additionally, your frequent exposure and intricate knowledge about the subject you study grants you advantage on all Constitution saving throws against being poisoned or affected by diseases, and you are immune to any diseases you have either contracted or successfully saved from in the past.
<h2>Transmission</h2>
Beginning at 10th level, you add the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=154">Contagion</a> spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. You know this spell by heart and it is always prepared, but does not count against your number of prepared spells. You may cast this spell once at its lowest level without expending a spell slot. If you do, you must complete a long rest before you can do so again.
<h2>Pandemic</h2>
Starting at 14th level, your extensive experience with the nature and spread of disease allows you manipulate it. When a target within 30 feet is under the effect of a disease or the Contagion or Great Malady spells, you can expend a spell slot as an action. All creatures within a range determined by the level of the spell slot expended of the target must make a Constitution saving throw or become affected by the disease or the contagion spell as if it were cast on it.<br><br>
Once a creature passes this Constitution saving throw or recovers from the contagion spell, they are immune to a Pandemic originating from the same casting of the contagion spell.
