        <h1>School of Transposition</h1>
        Wizards of the school of transposition, called transposers, learn magic related to teleportation and planar travel. Most planeswalkers have some experience in this school.
<h2>Transposition Savant</h2>
Starting when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a transposition spell into your spellbook is halved.
<h2>Telekinetic</h2>
Also starting at 2nd level, you can lift objects through magical force alone. You learn the Mage Hand cantrip, and the spectral hand is invisible when you cast it.<br><br>
If you already know the mage hand cantrip, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the arcane spell list.
<h2>Benign Transportation</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a transposition spell of 1st level or higher.
<h2>Blink Teleport</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can blink around the battlefield, teleporting rapidly. As a bonus action, you can expend 15 feet of your movement to teleport up to 10 feet away. You can use this feature once per turn.<br><br>
In addition, if your speed is currently reduced to 0, you may use your action to use this feature without expending movement.
<h2>Planeswalker</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can transport yourself across planes with ease. You can cast the Plane Shift spell without expending a spell slot. When cast in this way, the spell does not require material components, cannot transport unwilling creatures, and takes ten minutes to cast.<br><br>
You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.<br><br>
In addition, you have advantage on ability checks made to recall information about the outer planes or their inhabitants.
