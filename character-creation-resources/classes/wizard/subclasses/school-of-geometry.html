        <h1>School of Geometry</h1>
        The Geometry Tradition focuses on enhancing the use of magic through application of intense mathematical calculations. As a student of Geometry, you do not limit yourself to expertise within a single school of magic. Instead, you seek to understand and exploit the arcane connections which you can draw between different magical constructs. Some geometers are meticulous scientists, taking careful and precise measurements of the arcane aether. Others appear crazed or conspiratorial as they make hurried connections only they can understand.
<h2>Formula Savant</h2>
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a spell that affects an area in a cone, cylinder, cube, or sphere into spellbook is halved.
<h2>Spell Dots</h2>
Also, at 2nd level, you can conjure forth geometric points and lines when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. When you do so, you choose an unoccupied space within range of the spell, and a visible spell dot appears there for 1 minute. You can have a number of spell dots at once equal to half your wizard level. A creature that ends their turn within a spell dot must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 force damage.<br><br>
Additionally, you can use your bonus action to connect spell dots within 60 feet of yourself with a number of lines up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Each creature that has a line pass through their space must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or take 2d6 force damage. The spell dots connected in this way then disappear. A creature in the area of more than one line is affected only once.
<h2>Recalculate</h2>
At 6th level, you learn to shift your spell dots as you desire. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move a spell dot within 60 feet of you up to 30 feet in any direction. If you ram the spell dot into a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 force damage and the spell dot disappears.
<h2>Additional Area</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can connect the weave of the world and channel magic between your spell dots. When you cast a spell with an area of effect that includes one of your existing spell dots in its area, you can choose another existing spell dot within 60 feet of you to echo the effect. Each creature within 10 feet of the chosen spell dot is also affected by your spell. The dots then disappear. You cannot choose a dot created in casting this spell for this feature.
<h2>Create Shape</h2>
At 14th level, you can channel your arcane energy to create a geometric shape in an instant. As an action, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to create a number of spell dots equal to the slot level, placing each dot at a point you can see within 60 feet of you.
