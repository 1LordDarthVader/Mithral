<h1>Shaman</h1>

Shamans have gained a spiritual connection with animals, ancestor spirits, supernatural creatures, and all elements of nature. They are in constantly linked with the spirits of the Spirit World. They call upon the spirits of the lost and ancient to grant them knowledge and power, seeking to gain from them. Shamans are obliged and required to offer prayers and services to the spirits in order to receive favors in the form of spells and aid to the natural world.

<h2>Spirit Guide</h2>
When you choose this tradition at 2nd level, you can call upon the knowledge of spirits to gain insight on a variety of subjects. You add the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=281">Find Familiar</a> spell to your spellbook if you don't already know it.

When you finish a long rest, you choose one skill of your choice from any of the following: Arcana, History, Religion, or Nature. You gain proficiency with that skill, or if you already have proficiency in the skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with that skill, until the end of your next long rest.

<h2>Spirit Magic</h2>
Also, at 2nd level, you can conjure forth spirits to cast spells. These spirits can be in the form of spiritual animals, ancestors, or spectral balls of light. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you choose an unoccupied space within range of the spell, and a spirit appears at the point. You treat the spell you cast as if it originated from the spirit's space. The spirit then remains there for up to 1 minute and provides bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can have a number of spirits at once equal to half your wizard level. If a spirit you conjure would make you exceed your maximum, an existing spirit of your choice disappears.

Additionally, you can use your bonus action to cause any number of spirits within 60 feet of yourself dissipate in a burst of radiant light. Each creature within 5 feet of a spirit must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or take 2d6 radiant damage. A creature in the area of more than one spirit burst is affected only once.

<h2>Ghost Touch</h2>
At 6th level, as a bonus action on your turn, you can command a spirit within 60 feet of you to move up to 30 feet in any direction. You can have the spirit move into another creature's space. If you do, the spirit disappears and that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 radiant damage.

<h2>Spiritual Connection</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can channel magic between your spirits and have them echo your spells. When you cast a spell with an area of effect, you can choose an existing spirit within 60 feet of you to also carry the effect. Each creature within 10 feet of the chosen spirit is also affected by your spell. Once a spirit channels a spell this way, it disappears.

<h2>Spirit Summoner</h2>
At 14th level, you can channel your arcane energy to conjure spirits in an instant. As an action, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to create a number of spirits equal to the slot level, calling each into an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you.
