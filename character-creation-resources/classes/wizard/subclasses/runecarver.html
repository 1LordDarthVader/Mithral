<h1>Runecarver</h1>

<h2>Runes of Understanding</h2>

Starting at 2nd level, your study of runecraft has unlocked the ability to decode runes and languages, regardless of their origin. You are always under the effects of a
<a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=136">Comprehend Languages</a> spell.

<h2>Runic Empowerment</h2>

Also starting at 2nd level, you learn how to amplify your magic through the application of various runes. Your knowledge of these runes is stored in your spellbook, though you determine the runes' cosmetic appearance. For example, your runes could be engraved into the cover of your spellbook, glowing whenever you cast a spell, or you could work the shape and meaning of the runes directly into a spell's somatic and verbal components.

<br><br>You learn three
<a href="../runes.html">Runes</a> of your choice. You learn two additional runes of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th levels. Each time you learn new runes, you can also replace one rune you know with a different one. When you cast a spell using a spell slot, you can invoke one of the runes you know.

<br><br>You can invoke no more than one rune per spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Sigil of Warding</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can call on a rune of protection to guard yourself against threats. When you fail a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Runic Empowerment and succeed on the saving throw instead.

<h2>Rune Maven</h2>
Starting at 10th level, your understanding of runecraft has grown immensely. Whenever you use your Arcane Recovery feature, you also regain a number of your expended uses of Runic Empowerment. The number of uses you regain can be no more than half your Intelligence modifier, rounded up (minimum of 1).

<h2>Engraved Emnity</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you have mastered the art of wielding your runes directly against your foes. As a bonus action, you can target one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be magically marked by an enmity rune.

<br><br>The enmity rune appears as a faintly glowing mote of energy that hovers over the marked creature, which suffers the following effects:

<br><br><strong>Runecraft's Bane.</strong> The creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells you cast.

<br><br><strong>Unveiled Enemy.</strong> The radiance of the glowing rune makes the creature visible if it's invisible, and the creature can't become invisible while the rune persists.

<br><br><strong>Woeful Curse.</strong> When you mark the creature, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns for the duration, you can invoke the enmity rune to curse the creature until the start of your next turn. The next time one of your allies hits the cursed creature with an attack roll, the target also takes 1d8 force damage, and the curse ends.

<br><br>The enmity rune lasts for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). Once you have marked a creature in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use this feature again.
