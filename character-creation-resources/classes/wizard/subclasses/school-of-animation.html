        <h1>School of Animation</h1>
        Animation is a powerful subject of magic. The ability to create artificial life requires a great deal of magical energy and talent. Wizards who choose to pursue this magic usually come from the school of animation. Animators' magic is primarily conjuration and transmutation magic, and they gain the service of a powerful arcane companion known as a Wizard's Guardian.<br><br>
These wizards are known by many names, including animators, golemancers, and tinkers.
<h2>Minor Animation</h2>
Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, you can animate small objects to do various tasks. As an action, you can animate a Tiny nonliving object and give it a simple command. Objects animated in this way cannot attack. The object will attempt to complete your command for one hour or until it finishes the command, at which point it will deanimate. An object animated in this way has an AC of 10, 5 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and a flying speed of 30 feet with the ability to hover.<br><br>
You can use this feature three times, and regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.<br><br>
In addition, you gain proficiency with tinker's tools.
<h2>Wizard's Guardian</h2>
Also starting at 2nd level, you develop your Wizard's Guardian, a powerful arcane construct, to protect you in combat. It is a roughly humanoid construct, made of inorganic material such as clay, stone, or iron, and brought to life through magic.<br><br>
The guardian is friendly towards you and your companions and obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the Wizard's Guardian stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

In combat, the guardian shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the guardian can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. However, in this case it tries its hardest to protect you.<br><br>
If your guardian is destroyed, you can rebuild it over the course of a long rest.
<h2>Spell Storing</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to store magic in your guardian that it can unleash at a moment's notice. You can cast a spell of 3rd level or lower with a 1 action casting time on your guardian, and can choose to store the spell within the guardian. The spell then has no effect, but is instead stored within the guardian.<br><br>
At any point thereafter, your guardian can use its action to cast the spell using your casting ability and requiring no material components.<br><br>
You can also define a condition in which the guardian should cast the spell, and if this condition arises, the guardian can use its reaction to cast the spell in the same way.<br><br>
Your guardian can store one spell at a time, and attempting to store a new spell in the guardian will overwrite the currently stored spell.
<h2>Superior Guardian</h2>
Starting at 10th level, when you command your guardian to take the Attack action, it can make two attacks.
<h2>Titanic Guardian</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you improve your guardian and make it much larger. It gains the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Its size increases to Large.</li>
<li>It gains additional hit points equal to three times your wizard level.</li>
<li>Its Armor Class increases by 2.</li>
</ul>
