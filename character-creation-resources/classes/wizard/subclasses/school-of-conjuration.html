        <h1>School of Conjuration</h1>
        Wizards of the school of conjuration can create objects and creatures out of thin air to aid them. To a conjurer, creating something as simple as a torch is just as easy as creating something as complicated as an entire living organism.
<h2>Conjuration Savant</h2>
Starting when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.
<h2>Minor Conjuration</h2>
Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet.<br><br>
The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, or if it takes any damage.
<h2>Mighty Summons</h2>
Starting at 6th level, the attacks of any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical damage.
<h2>Focused Conjuration</h2>
Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a conjuration spell, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.
<h2>Durable Summons</h2>
Starting at 14th level, any creature that you summon or create with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points.
