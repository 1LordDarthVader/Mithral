        <h1>School of Demonology</h1>
        The tradition of Demonology specializes in the study of fiends, and encourages its practitioners to make use of demonic power for their own purposes. This tradition combines principles of conjuration, abjuration, and enchantment, allowing demonologist wizards to summon fiendish creatures from the Abyss to serve them, as well as to command them and protect others from their evil caprice.<br><br>
These wizards spend their entire lives studying demons and mastering the secrets of their control. The most powerful demonologists can maintain control over greater demons even without knowing their true names.
<h2>Demonic Servant</h2>
At 2nd level, you add the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=281">Find Familiar</a> spell to your spellbook, if it's not there already.<br><br>
When you cast this spell, you can choose a quasit instead of one of the normal forms for your familiar.<br><br>
Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.
<h2>Demonic Tongue</h2>
Also at 2nd level, you learn the Abyssal language if you don't already know it. In addition, you count as if you were proficient in Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion when you make Charisma checks against demons. If you are already proficient in any of these skills, your proficiency bonus for those checks is doubled.
<h2>Demonic Summoning</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you add the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=739">Summon Lesser Demons</a> spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you gain this class feature, you learn the names of two demons, neither of which can have a challenge rating greater than 1.<br><br>
When you cast summon lesser demons, the demons are under your control. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the demons, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. At the end of each of their turns, the demons can make a single Charisma saving throw as a group against your spell save DC to break away from your control. On a successful save, your control of the demons end and the demons pursue and attack the nearest non-demons to the best of their ability. The demons have disadvantage on this saving throw if you say the true name of one of the demons.<br><br>
Whenever a spell that summons demons calls for blood from a humanoid killed within the past 24 hours, you can use your own blood as the material component instead.
<h2>True Names</h2>
As you gain levels in this class, you learn the true names of demons. You learn a true name at 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, and 17th levels. When you learn a true name, the CR of the demon must be equal to or lower than half your wizard level.
<h2>Wrack the Spirit</h2>
At 10th level, you can cause otherworldly beings to suffer excruciating pain. As an action, you utter words of power and one target celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the target fails its saving throw, it is wracked with pain for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.<br><br>
While wracked with pain this way, the target's speed drops to 0 feet and it makes attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws with disadvantage.<br><br>
You can use Wrack the Spirit a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1). You regain expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Master of Demons</h2>
When you reach 14th level, you learn the names of a number of demons equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier. No demon whose name you learned in this way can have a challenge rating greater than 12.<br><br>
In addition, when you cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=738">Summon Greater Demon</a> spell, the maximum challenge rating of the fiends you can summon increases by an amount equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1).<br><br>
Once you use use a true name to summon a particular demon, you cannot use it to summon the same demon again until you finish a long rest.
