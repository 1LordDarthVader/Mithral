        <h1>Generalist</h1>
        While many wizards focus on mastering a particular school of magic, there are a handful of wizards who want to master as much of the arcane arts as they can. These wizards, often called ‘generalists', focus on acquiring spells and learning as much as they can regarding the arcane. These wizards learn how to eventually change their prepared spells, cast more spells, and increase their focus with spellcasting.
<h2>Arcane Repertoire</h2>
Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, your knowledge of magic has increased, as well as your skills at acquiring magic. You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill, and whenever you gain a wizard level, you can increase the number of spells that you add to your spellbook by 1.
<h2>Recycle Magic</h2>
Also at 2nd level, you have learned how to replenish your magical reservoir. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can use your bonus action to regain an expended spell slot up to half that spell's level (minimum of 1).<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Adaptive Spellbook</h2>
At 6th level, you have learned how to prepare at a moment's notice. As an action, you can swap out any number of your prepared spells for spells you do not have prepared.<br><br>
Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Double Spell</h2>
By 10th level, you have learned enough about the mechanics behind spells to know how to push your limit with casting them. Whenever you cast an arcane spell of 1st level or higher, as part of the same action, you can cast another arcane spell with a casting time of 1 action provided that both spells do not require concentration and you have the appropriate spell slot necessary for both spells.<br><br>
Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Spell Expert</h2>
By 14th level, whenever you lose concentration on a spell, you can use your reaction to instead maintain your concentration by expending a spell slot of the same level, or a number of lower level spell slots with a total number of levels equal to or greater than the level of the spell you are concentrating on.
