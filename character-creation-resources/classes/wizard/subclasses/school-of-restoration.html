        <h1>School of Restoration</h1>
        The wizardry school of restoration is a school of thought that involves bending the weave to emulate the magic of the divine. Wizards of this school, called restorers or menders (or sometimes blasphemers or heretics), can uniquely heal comrades and even revive the dead.
<h2>Restoration Savant</h2>
        Starting when you choose this subclass at 2nd level, you learn one <a href="../../../spells/schools/restoration.html">Restoration</a> cantrip and two 1st-level restoration spells of your choice. They are considered arcane spells for you.<br><br>
In addition, whenever you gain a new level of spell slot, you learn two restoration spells of your choice of a level for which you have spell slots.
<h2>Enhanced Healing</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you know how to manipulate the weave to perform healing more easily. Whenever you cast a spell that restores hit points, it restores a minimum number of hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1).
<h2>Overhealing</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can heal creatures beyond their normal limits. When you cast a healing spell that would heal a creature above their maximum hit points, they gain temporary hit points equal to the difference.
<h2>Extreme Healing</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can empower your healing spells to be extremely potent. When you cast a spell that restores hit points, you can choose to increase the dice used for healing by one step (d6 to d8, d8 to d10, etc), to a maximum of d12s. In addition, when you use this feature, the spell restores the maximum number of hit points possible.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once) and regain all expended uses on a long rest.<br><br>
In addition, you have the option of expending multiple uses of this feature at once, increasing the die size by more than one step.
