<h2>Class Features</h2>
As a sharpshooter, you gain the following class features

<h3>Hit Points</h3>
<strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per sharpshooter level
<br><br><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier
<br><br><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per sharpshooter level after 1st

<h3>Proficiencies</h3>
<strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields
<br><br><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons
<br><br><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Dexterity
<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose three from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Medicine, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>(a) scale mail or (b) leather armor</li>
    <li>(a) a heavy crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) a longbow and 20 arrows</li>
    <li>(a) two daggers or (b) a kukri</li>
    <li>an equipment pack</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adrenaline Rush</h3>
Starting at 1st level, in battle, your adrenaline increases your speed and your clarity. As a bonus action you can enter an adrenaline rush. While in an adrenaline rush, you gain the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>You have advantage on Dexterity checks and on saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</li>
    <li>Your movement speed increases as you gain levels as a sharpshooter, as shown in the adrenaline speed increase column of the Sharpshooter table. You only gain the movement speed increase while in an adrenaline rush.</li>
    <li>If you are able to cast spells, you can only cast spells that deal damage while in an adrenaline rush.</li>
</ul>

Your adrenaline rush lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your adrenaline rush on your turn as a bonus action.

<br><br>Once you have used your adrenaline rush the number of times shown for your sharpshooter level in the adrenaline rushes column of the Sharpshooter table, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

<h3>Expertise</h3>
Also at 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen skills.

<h3>Fighting Style</h3>
At 2nd level you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again

<h4>Archery</h4>
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

<h4>Blind Fighting</h4>
You have blind sight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

<h4>Close Quarters Shooter</h4>
When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

<h4>Defensive Fighting</h4>
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

<h4>Dual Wielding</h4>
When you take the Attack action while two-weapon fighting, you can make a single additional attack with your off-hand weapon as part of your action instead of your bonus action, adding your ability modifier to the damage of this attack.

<h4>Dueling</h4>
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

<h4>Featherweight Fighting</h4>
While you are wielding only light weapons, your movement speed increases by 10 feet and you gain a +2 bonus to your damage rolls, so long as you are not wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or wielding a shield.

<h4>Melee Marksman</h4>
When you make a ranged attack targeting a creature within 5 feet of you, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll.
<br><br>
If you make a ranged attack against a creature within 5 feet, you can use a bonus action to strike the creature with your ranged weapon, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage on hit.

<h4>Strongbow</h4>
You can use your Strength score, in place of your Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls with bows. If using a composite bow, its special property changes to add your Dexterity modifier to the damage.

<h4>Thrown Weapon Fighting</h4>
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
<br><br>
In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

<h3>Efficient Combat Training</h3>
Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to utilize your finesse even if the weapon normally wouldn't allow it. All weapons gain the Finesse property for you if they lack the Heavy property.

<h3>Special Training</h3>
At 3rd level, you pick a field to receive special training in. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th levels.

<ul>
    <li><a href="./subclasses/combat-medic-training.html">Combat Medic Training</a></li>
    <li><a href="./subclasses/commando-training.html">Commando Training</a></li>
    <li><a href="./subclasses/demolitionist-training.html">Demolitionist Training</a></li>
    <li><a href="./subclasses/sniper-training.html">Sniper Training</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

<h3>Martial Versatility</h3>
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to sharpshooters. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.

<h3>Extra Attack</h3>
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

<h3>Nimble Escape</h3>
Starting at 6th level, your training allows you react quickly to incoming strikes, reducing the damage you take. When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

<h3>Battle Readiness</h3>
Starting at 9th level, your resolve and fitness level help you push past fatigue. Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid exhuastion and can remove 1 level of exhaustion during a short rest.

<h3>Unwavering Loyalty</h3>
Starting at 11th level, your loyalty to your allies and your cause is unshakeable. You are immune to being charmed or forced to act agaisnt your own will.

<h3>Lingering Adrenaline Rush</h3>
Starting at 13th level, your adrenaline rush only ends early if you fall unconscious or you choose to end it early. In addition, when you succeed on a dexterity saving throw to take half damage, you instead take no damage.

<h3>Fortified Position</h3>
Starting at 14th level, you use your knowledge of battle to fortify your position against the enemy. You and allies within 10 feet gain the benefits of half cover and cannot be forecfully moved by non-magical means.

<h3>Adrenaline Surge</h3>
Starting at 17th level, while you are in an adrenaline rush, you can use your action to cause an adrenaline surge, further increasing your abilities. When you cause an adrenaline surge, you gain the benefits of the Haste spell as if you cast it on yourself, for 1 minute. You can use this feature once per short rest and gain 1 level of exhaustion, which is removed during a short rest and does not count as a level removed by your Battle Readiness feature.

<h3>Finish the Fight</h3>
At 20th level, you are determined to finish the fight, no matter the cost, and push yourself beyond your limits. When you are below half your hit point maximum, you can use an action to gain the following benefits for the next minute:

<ul>
    <li>You become immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and have resistance to all other damage.</li>
    <li>If you are dropped to 0 hit points, you do not fall unconscious, but still make death saving throws and suffer the normal effects of taking damage at 0 hit points.</li>
    <li>You are immune to being grappled, paralyzed, petrified, restrained, and stunned, and you can stand up from prone with no movement cost.</li>
    <li>You can't be forcefully moved, your speed can't be reduced by any means, and you can move through any creature's space, but can't end your turn there.</li>
</ul>

When the minute elapses, you suffer two levels of exhaustion.  Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
