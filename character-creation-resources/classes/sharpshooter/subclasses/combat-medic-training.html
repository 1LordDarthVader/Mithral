<h1>Combat Medic Training</h1>

Combat medics are those who keep their allies alive and fighting. Armed with medicine and bandages, they treat their friends' wounds in the midst of the battlefield while defending them from the enemy onslaught.

<h2>Field Medic</h2>

<br><br>In addition, you gain the ability to heal a creature quickly in a pinch.  You gain a Medicine Die, which is a d8.  As an action, you can touch a willing creature within 5 feet of you.  The target regains hit points equal to a roll of your Medicine Die plus your Wisdom modifier.

<br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Close Quarters Combat Training</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you have received extensive training in fighting at small distances. When you are wielding a ranged weapon, you do not suffer disadvantage as a result of being within 5 feet of a hostile creature.
