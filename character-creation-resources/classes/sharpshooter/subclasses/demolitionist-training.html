<h1>Demolitionist Training</h1>

Demolitionists are sharpshooters who have received special training to work with explosives. They are able to apply this knowledge to diffuse and disarm explosive traps left behind by their foes and craft their own explosives that they use in battle.

<h2>Explosives Training</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you have trained in use of explosive devices.  You gain proficiency with tinker's tools, and you can use your tinker's tools to arm or disarm explosives.

<br><br>Certain features of this subclass use your Explosives Save DC, which is calculated as follows:

<br><br><strong>Explosives Save DC = </strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

<h2>Grenade Crafting</h2>
Also starting at 3rd level, you have trained how to construct basic explosive grenades using your tinker's tools. At the end of a short or long rest you can craft a number of grenades equal to your proficiency bonus.

<br><br>Grenades are a thrown weapon with which you are proficient.  They have a short range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet, and deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit.  In addition, after you throw a grenade, hit or miss, all creatures within 5 feet of the grenade must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw and half as much damage on a successful saving throw.

<br><br>Grenades crafted with this feature are unstable, and only last until you finish a short or long rest.

<h2>Excavation-Grade Explosives</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you have trained in the use of excavation-grade explosives, improving the effect of your grenades. The damage dealt by your grenades increases to 4d6 and the radius they affect increases to 10 feet. The damage dealt by explosives that you have crafted is considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical damage.

<br><br>In addition, you gain resistance to fire damage.

<h2>Mines</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you begin constructing explosive mines. Mines can be set as a trap within 5 feet of you as an action by expending one of your grenades, and when a creature enters their space, the mine detonates.  A mine's detonation functions identically to that of your grenades.

<h2>Improved Explosive Engineering</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you have mastered the art of crafting explosive devices.  The damage of your grenades increases to 6d6 and the radius they affect increases to 15 feet.

<h2>Military-Grade Explosives</h2>
Starting at 18th level, you have trained in the use of military-grade explosives, maximizing the effect of all your explosives. The damage dealt by grenades increases to 8d6 and the radius they affect increases to 20 feet.
