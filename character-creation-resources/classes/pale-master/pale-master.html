<h1>Pale Master</h1>

The Pale Master is a magic user obsessed with the study of life and death. They specialize in spells and incantations that allow them to harness the very life-force that flows through all creatures. Where a life-force is not present, they are able to instill a mimicry of foul life, rising these dead creatures from their once peaceful earthen resting places.

<h2>Class Features</h2>

As a pale master, you gain the following class features.

<h3>Hit Points</h3>
<strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per pale master level<br>
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br>
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per pale master level after 1st

<h3>Proficiencies</h3>
<strong>Armor:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Clubs, daggers, darts, shortbows, slings, quarterstaves, batons, knobkerries, light crossbows<br>
<strong>Tools:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Constitution, Intelligence<br>
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two skills from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>(a) a quarterstaff or (b) a simple melee weapon</li>
    <li>(a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</li>
    <li>a grimoire and an equipment pack</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bulwark of the Undead</h3>
At 1st level, you learn to harness the gifts possessed by the undead creatures in your company. You gain immunity to disease and while you are wearing no armor and are not wielding a shield, your AC equals 13 + your Constitution modifier as your skin becomes as hard as bone.

<h3>Spellcasting</h3>
As a student of necromantic magic, you have obtained a grimoire containing spells dealing with the dark arts. At first, your ability to understand the scripture in this tome is limited.
<br><br>
However, you are told that through devoted study and practice you will be able to decipher more of the pages, and the potency of the spells available to you will become formidable. Unlike more traditional arcane casters, you are unable to learn spells from schools of magic other than necromancy unless they are granted by your chosen requiem.

<h4>Cantrips</h4>
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the <a href="../../spells/classes/pale-master.html">pale master spell list</a>. You learn additional pale master cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Pale Master table.

<h4>Grimoire</h4>
At 1st level, you obtain a tome containing all of the currently known pale master spells in the realm. There are a few blank pages at the back of the grimoire, allowing you to inscribe any requiem spells you learn during your travels when you choose which requiem path to follow.
<br><br>
The spells that you decipher in your grimoire as you gain levels reflect the research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had while dealing with undead.

<h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
The Pale Master table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher.
<br><br>
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
<br><br>
You prepare the list of necromancy spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of pale master spells from your grimoire equal to your Intelligence modifier + your pale master level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
<br><br>
For example, if you’re a 3rd-level pale master you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your grimoire. If you prepare the 1st-level spell inflict wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.
<br><br>
You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of pale master spells requires time spent studying your grimoire and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your pale master spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.
<br><br>
<strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier<br>
<strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

<h4>Ritual Casting</h4>
You can cast a pale master spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag, as the spell is in your grimoire. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.

<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your pale master spells. Your Undead Graft, obtained at 3rd level, can also be used as your spellcasting focus.

<h4>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
Each time you gain a pale master level, you are able to decipher more of your grimoire. When you gain a new spell slot level, you are able to understand and cast the corresponding level of spells if you have them prepared.

<h4>Replacing a Grimoire</h4>
Your grimoire is an ancient tome that was given to you and is thus practically irreplaceable.
<br><br>
However, you are able to copy a spell from your own grimoire into another tome – for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your grimoire. This is a lengthy and painstaking process, particularly for the spells you have not yet deciphered and used.
<br><br>
For spells you are able to cast, coping the spell is just like scribing onto a scroll, but faster and easier, since you understand the notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp. for each level of the copied spell.
<br><br>
For spells you cannot yet cast, the process is much more difficult. To retain the incantation’s meaning, you must copy it exactly. To do so, you may make an arcana check against a DC 15 for second levels spells. This DC further increases by 2 for every additional spell level you wish to transcribe.
<br><br>
For this reason, it is very rare for a pale master to make copies of their grimoire; rather choosing to value it above all their other material possessions.

<h4>The Grimoire’s Appearance</h4>
A pale master’s grimoire tends to don runes inlaid into a black leather cover, which symbolize the dark magic contained within.

<h3>Requiem of Souls</h3>
The study of the dark arts is ancient, stretching back to the earliest discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the realm. At 1st level, choose which requiem you will follow; shaping your understanding of dark magic through their practice. Your choice grants you requiem spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you an undead graft feature specific to your requiem at 3rd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

<ul>
<li><a href="./subclasses/requiem-of-the-ash.html">Requiem of the Ash</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/requiem-of-the-frigid.html">Requiem of the Frigid</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/requiem-of-the-haunt.html">Requiem of the Haunt</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/requiem-of-the-torpor.html">Requiem of the Torpor</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Dark Mending</h3>
Beginning at 2nd level, you are able heal your wounds and the wounds of undead creations you have created by channeling forbidden necromantic energies. When you or an undead creature under your control that you can see within 60 feet of you is hit with an attack but before the damage is rolled, you can use your reaction to heal the target for an amount equal to one Dark Mending die, a d6. If the target creature is your undead servant, it is healed for double the amount.
<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<br><br>
Your Dark Mending die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

<h3>Death’s Whisper</h3>
Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to cast speak with dead as a ritual. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
<br><br>
Also, the undead who lurk in the dark begin to lose their mystery. You gain darkvision out to 60 feet (if you already have darkvision, its effective distance is increased by 30 feet), you become proficient with the Religion skill if you are not already and you have advantage on all Religion skill checks if they are related to the undead.

<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

<h3>Deathless Vigor</h3>
At 6th level, your body becomes more akin to the undead you keep in your cohort. You become resistant to necrotic damage.
<br><br>
Additionally, you are able to reroll a failed Constitution saving throw but must take the second result. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h3>Thrall’s Boon</h3>
At 10th level, the bond you share with your undead servant strengthens. Using your action, you are able to command your servant to use its reaction to touch a creature within 5 feet of it, delivering any of your spells or abilities with a range of touch.
<br><br>
You may use your combat statistics in place of your servant’s if they are greater.

<h3>Undead Acclimation</h3>
By 17th level, you have spent so much time dealing with undead and the powers of animation that you gain prowess over some of their most predominant effects.
<br><br>
When you are hit with an attack that deals critical damage, the attack does normal damage instead. Additionally, you are immune to necrotic damage and your hit point maximum cannot be reduced.

<h3>Necromastery</h3>
At 18th level, you have gained mastery over certain necromancy spells, allowing you to cast them at will.
<br><br>
Choose a 1st-level pale master spell and a 1st or 2nd-level pale master spell that are in your grimoire and belong to the necromancy school of magic. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
<br><br>
By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.

<h3>Rebuke the Grave</h3>
At 20th level, when you take a single source of damage that would knock you unconscious or kill you outright, you may use this feature as a reaction to take no damage instead.
<br><br>
You can choose to allow your servant to use this ability with its reaction instead of yourself. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.
