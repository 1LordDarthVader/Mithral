<h2>Tenebrous Shadow Servant</h2>
At 1st level, you forge a Penumbra Bond with the undead, allowing you to use your magic to animate one undead servant in the form of a tenebrous shadow.<br><br>
With 8 hours of work, a burning incense and a small sacrifice of your own blood, you complete a ritual that pulls a soul back from the afterlife and binds it into servitude as your faithful servant.<br><br>
If your servant is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp. worth of rare bone dust, you can again preform a ritual to pull your servant back to the material plane.

<h2>Peumbra Bond</h2>
Your shadow obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.<br><br>
Your shadow has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your servant uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. The proficiency bonus applies to the areas where it would normally.
<h3>Hit Points, Ability Scores &amp; Skill Proficiency</h3>
For each pale master level you gain after 1st, your servant gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.<br><br>
Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your servant's abilities also improve. Your servant can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your servant can't increase an ability score above 20.
<h3>Alignment &amp; Personality Traits</h3>
Your servant shares your alignment and ideal. Its bond, trait, and flaw are decided by you upon its creation.
<h2>Mist Graft</h2>
Upon reaching 3rd level, you graft a necrotic rune into your arm. After 24 hours, dark strands of mist seep out of the pours in your arm, lingering in the air around the appendage.<br><br>
Your undead graft becomes a spellcasting focus for your magic, allowing you to cast spells with it and ignore material components that do not have a cost. Also, your graft is considered to be a simple weapon that you are proficient with, which deals 1d8 necrotic damage. When attacking with the graft, you can use your Strength or Intelligence modifier for the attack and damage rolls.<br><br>
At 6th level, your graft counts as magical and gains a +1 bonus to melee attacks and damage. This increases to a +2 bonus at 12th level and a +3 bonus at 16th level.
<h2>Chilling Touch</h2>
At 6th level, when you make a melee attack using your undead graft against a target, it can cause profound trepidation. On a successful attack, the target takes an additional 2d8 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or its Wisdom Ability Score is reduced by 2d4 and it is blinded until the target completes a short or long rest.<br><br>
You can use this feature once per long rest at 6th level. You gain an additional use at 14th level. Expended uses are regained when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Greater Undead Servant</h2>
At 10th level, your understanding of necromantic magic allows you strengthen your servant's power. Your servant gains two feats of your choosing from the following list:
<ul>
<li>Alert</li>
<li>Mage Slayer</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
<li>Skilled</li>
<li>Skulker</li>
</ul>
<h2>Terror in the Night</h2>
Starting at 10th level, if your tenebrous shadow servant deals damage to a creature, you may use your reaction to force the target to succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of its next turn if it is within 30 feet of you.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Secrecy of Shadow</h2>
Starting at 14th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn. If the spell is cast using your Thrall's Boon feature, only you need to be hidden from the target, not your servant.
