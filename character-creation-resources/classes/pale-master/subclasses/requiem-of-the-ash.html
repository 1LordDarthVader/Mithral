<h1>Requiem of the Ash</h1>
Requiem of the Ash Pale Masters focus on the ebbs and flows of life and death. They feel most comfortable surrounded by armies made of bone, and have expanded their prowess to utilize rudimentary flame magic to aid in the process of turning creatures to ash, feeding the regrowth process.
<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
This requiem lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a new spell. The following spells are added to the Pale Master spell list for you.

<h2>Dust Skeleton Servant</h2>
At 1st level, you forge an Ashen Bond with the undead, allowing you to use your magic to animate an undead servant in the form of a dust skeleton.<br><br>
With 8 hours of work, a pile of bones and a small sacrifice of your own blood, you complete a ritual that imbues the bones with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature to become your faithful servant.<br><br>
If your servant is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp. worth of rare bone dust, you again enchant the pile of bones with magic to restore it to sentience. You can return the skeleton to undeath in this manner even if you do not possess all the remaining parts of its body.

<h2>Ashen Bond</h2>
Your skeleton obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your servant acts on its own.<br><br>
Your skeleton has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your servant uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. The proficiency bonus applies to the areas where it would normally.
<h3>Hit Points, Ability Scores &amp; Skill Proficiency</h3>
For each pale master level you gain after 1st, your servant gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.<br><br>
Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your servant's abilities also improve. Your servant can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your servant can't increase an ability score above 20.
<h3>Alignment &amp; Personality Traits</h3>
Your servant shares your alignment and ideal. Its bond, trait, and flaw are decided by you upon its creation.
<h2>Skeletal Graft</h2>
Upon reaching 3rd level, you graft a necrotic rune into your arm. After 24 hours, the flesh dissolves from your arm, leaving behind a skeletal appendage.<br><br>
Your undead graft becomes a spellcasting focus for your magic, allowing you to cast spells with it and ignore material components that do not have a cost. Also, your graft is considered to be a simple weapon that you are proficient with, which deals 1d8 necrotic damage. When attacking with the graft, you can use your Strength or spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls.<br><br>
At 6th level, your graft counts as magical and gains a +1 bonus to melee attacks and damage. This increases to a +2 bonus at 12th level and a +3 bonus at 16th level.
<h2>Paralyzing Touch</h2>
At 6th level, when you make a melee attack using your undead graft against a target, it can cause paralysis. On a successful attack, the target takes an additional 2d8 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or become paralyzed for 1 minute.<br><br>
The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><br>
You can use this feature once per long rest at 6th level. You gain an additional use at 14th level. Expended uses are regained when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Greater Undead Servant</h2>
At 10th level, your understanding of necromantic magic allows you strengthen your servant's power. Your servant gains two feats of your choosing from the following list:
<ul>
    <li><a href="../../feats/alert.html">Alert</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../feats/charger.html">Charger</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../feats/moderately-armored.html">Moderately Armored</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../feats/resilient.html">Resilient</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../feats/savage-attacker.html">Savage Attacker</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../feats/skulker.html">Skulker</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Reanimation</h2>
At 10th level, you gain the ability to focus your energy and reanimate your servant, forgoing the typical process. As a reaction, if your dust skeleton servant is within 120 feet of you and dies, you are able to return a foul mimicry of life, raising it with half of its total hit points.<br><br>
Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Ossien Armor</h2>
At 14th level, a touch from your skeletal graft can momentarily encase a target in bone to mitigate damage from an incoming attack. As a reaction, you can half the damage from a single source for a willing creature or target that you can see within 5 feet.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.
