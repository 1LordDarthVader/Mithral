<h2>Rotting Zombie Servant</h2>
At 1st level, you forge a Perishing Bond with the undead, allowing you to use your magic to animate one undead servant in the form of a rotting zombie (stats on pg. 17).<br><br>
With 8 hours of work, a corpse and a small sacrifice of your own blood, you complete a ritual that enchants the corpse with dark magic, raising it as an undead creature to become as your faithful servant.<br><br>
If your servant is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp. worth of rare bone dust, you again enchant a corpse with magic to restore it to sentience. You can return the zombie to undeath in this manner even if you do not possess all the remaining parts of its body.

<h2>Perishing Bond</h2>
Your zombie obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your servant acts on its own.<br><br>
Your zombie has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your servant uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. The proficiency bonus applies to the areas where it would normally.
<h3>Hit Points, Ability Scores &amp; Skill Proficiency</h3>
For each pale master level you gain after 1st, your servant gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.<br><br>
Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your servant's abilities also improve. Your servant can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your servant can't increase an ability score above 20.
<h3>Alignment &amp; Personality Traits</h3>
Your servant shares your alignment and ideal. Its bond, trait, and flaw are decided by you upon its creation.
<h2>Decay Graft</h2>
Upon reaching 3rd level, you graft a necrotic rune into your arm. After 24 hours, the flesh on your arm begins to rot, forming pustules on the appendage.<br><br>
Your undead graft becomes a spellcasting focus for your magic, allowing you to cast spells with it and ignore material components that do not have a cost. Also, your graft is considered to be a simple weapon that you are proficient with, which deals 1d8 necrotic damage. When attacking with the graft, you can use your Strength or spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls.<br><br>
At 6th level, your graft counts as magical and gains a +1 bonus to melee attacks and damage. This increases to a +2 bonus at 12th level and a +3 bonus at 16th level.
<h2>Weakening Touch</h2>
At 6th level, when you make a melee attack using your undead graft against a target, it can cripple a foe. On a successful attack, the target takes an additional 2d8 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or its Strength Ability Score is reduced by 2d4 and it is poisoned until the target completes a short or long rest.<br><br>
You can use this feature once per long rest at 6th level. You gain an additional use at 14th level. Expended uses are regained when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Greater Undead Servant</h2>
At 10th level, your understanding of necromantic magic allows you strengthen your servant's power. Your servant gains two feats of your choosing from the following list:
<ul>
    <li><a href="../../feats/alert.html">Alert</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../feats/grappler.html">Grappler</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../feats/heavily-armored.html">Heavily Armored</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../feats/resilient.html">Resilient</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../feats/tough.html">Tough</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../feats/skulker.html">Skulker</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Undead Cohort</h2>
Starting at 10th level, any zombie that you create with a necromancy spell has 10 temporary hit points upon creation.<br><br>
Additionally, your rotting zombie servant gains 10 temporary hit points whenever it makes an initiative roll.
<h2>Billowing Decay</h2>
At 14th level, if a humanoid dies while standing in a cloudkill spell that you cast, they become a zombie under your control at the end of your next turn and obey your mental commands.<br><br>
The only action they can take is the Attack action, making one melee attack. The zombies last for 1 minute, after which time they collapse and die.
