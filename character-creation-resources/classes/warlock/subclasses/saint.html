        <h1>Saint</h1>
        Your patron is a saint, one who ascended into greatness and a higher afterlife through their actions, piety, and faith. This saint serves a particular god, helping to uphold their domains, dominion, and goals, and thus watches over followers of their faith and aims to protect them. A saint can serve and follow any particular god or otherworldly being, be they good evil, or somewhere in between. However, saints have their own goals as one of their god's many agents in the world.<br><br>
Those who make a pact with a saint might be devout followers of the god the saint serves, ready to enact their will and devote their life to serving them. Some may seek to honor and defend the saint themselves, possibly having even known them when they were mortal. Some might take up the role of an exorcist, holy warrior, or temple guardian, while others are charged with a divinely inspired task or endeavor by the gods. Others still might yearn for a more active and personal relationship with a religious figure, and might long to become a saint themselves.

<h2>Acolyte's Knowledge</h2>
At 1st level, your connection to your patron saint has granted you additional knowledge and abilities. You gain proficiency in the Religion skill.<br><br>
In addition, you learn the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=765">Thaumaturgy</a> and <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=849">Word of Radiance</a> cantrips. They are warlock cantrips for you, and do not count against your number of cantrips known.
<h2>Benevolent Prayer</h2>
Beginning at 1st level you can enter a state of active meditation wherein your patron saint blesses you with power and protection. As a bonus action, you can utter a quick prayer. For 1 minute, or until you become incapacitated or die, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>You have advantage on saving throws against curses and effects that would remove your soul from your body.</li>
<li>Whenever you deal damage with a warlock cantrip or a weapon attack, you can choose to deal necrotic or radiant damage (your choice) instead of the normal damage.</li>
<li>Whenever you regain hit points, you gain additional hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Protective Retribution</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can punish those who would harm yourself or your companions with holy or unholy energy. When a creature makes an attack roll against you or an ally within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you or your ally, the creature takes necrotic or radiant damage (your choice) equal to your warlock level as a burst of light or darkness blasts into them, and the creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. The creature can repeat this saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns, ending the effect on a successful save.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Purified Soul</h2>
At 10th level, your body becomes altered by the strength of your devotion. You become immune to disease and the frightened condition, and you gain resistance to necrotic or radiant damage (your choice).
<h2>Martyr's Sacrifice</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to whisper a quick prayer to your patron saint. When you do so, you immediately drop to 0 hit points, though you are considered stable, and you gain a level of exhaustion. Choose from one of the following effects:
<ul>
<li><strong>Restoration.</strong> You become enveloped in a bright light that suddenly flashes outwards. You can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your warlock level. Choose any number of creatures within 30 feet of you, not including yourself, and divide those hit points among them. Additionally, any curse, disease, or poison currently affecting the target creatures immediately ends.</li>
<li><strong>Punishment.</strong> You become enveloped in a shroud of light or darkness that suddenly bursts outwards. All hostile creatures within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) and is cursed for 1 minute. While cursed, a creature suffers from the effects of the bane spell. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't cursed.</li>
</ul>
Once you use an effect granted by this feature, you can't use either effect again until you finish a long rest.
