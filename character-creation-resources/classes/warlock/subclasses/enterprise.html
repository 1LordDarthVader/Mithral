        <h1>Enterprise</h1>
        Hushed whispers fill your mind, informing you that your life is not entirely your own. You are a cog in the machine, with a contract, rules, and powers given and taken. Perhaps you were knowledgeable and unscrupulous, willing to bargain away life and soul to some dark organization to gain some measure of power from the cabal with whom you've made your pact. Will you use it to further the goals of your patron, or will you bite the hand that feeds you and turn against the masters that rule your organization? The choice is yours, but the price must be paid in blood.
<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
The Enterprise lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

<h2>Magic at a Price</h2>
When you choose this patron at 1st level, you can choose to conceal currency you possess in a pocket dimension, which you can access using a bonus action. If you die, the currency reappears on your corpse.<br><br>
You can capture souls with gold and with blood and force them to serve you. When a Small or larger creature is reduced to 0 hit points within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to capture a fraction of their soul and gain one soul coin. Once you've acquired a soul coin from a creature, you can't get more from them. You cannot acquire soul coins from any undead without a soul, such as zombies.<br><br>
Creatures other than you perceive soul coins as regular currency equivalent in value to 1 gp. You are always aware of who is in possession of one of your soul coins. You have a maximum number of soul coins equal to half your warlock level (minimum of 1).<br><br>
As an action, you can start concentrating, and choose to either see or hear through a soul coin as if you were in its space for up to 1 minute, or until you lose concentration. For the duration, a translucent face of the tormented mortal whose soul you captured appears on the obverse of the coin. After you do so, the coin is destroyed.
<h2>Paid in Blood</h2>
Also at 1st level, as a bonus action, you may call upon the debts that are owed and expend one soul coin to demand protection. For 1 minute, if you are wearing no armor and wielding no shield, your base AC becomes 10 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your Dexterity modifier.
<h2>Question the Soul</h2>
At 6th level, your mastery over souls allows you to read your servants and adversaries alike. As an action, you can touch a creature and force them to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, the target is paralyzed until the start of your next turn as you demand answers of their soul. While the target is paralyzed, you can ask them up to five questions (no action required) and receive brief telepathic answers, which you can understand regardless of the language used. The soul is limited by its knowledge, but must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>The Toll at the Gates</h2>
At 10th level, you may spend one soul coin as an action to partially enter the ethereal plane. Until the start of your next turn, you have resistance to all damage and become invisible to creatures more than 10 feet away from you.<br><br>
Additionally, if you would be reduced to 0 hit points and you are protected by your Paid in Blood feature, you may immediately sacrifice the remnants of the soul (no action required), ending the effects of Paid in Blood to instead drop to 1 hit point. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Soul Puppeteer</h2>
At 14th level, as an action, you can attempt to magically ensnare and control the actions of a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. If they fail, you can take total and precise control of the ensnared creature. Until the start of your next turn, you can see and hear through your target's senses, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the target has, and the creature takes only actions that you choose and can't do anything that you don't allow it to. During this time, you can use your reaction to force the creature to take a reaction.<br><br>
Once you attempt to magically ensnare a creature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
