        <h1>Fiend</h1>
        You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz'Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.
<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

<h2>Dark One's Blessing</h2>
Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).
<h2>Dark One's Own Luck</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Fiendish Resilience</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.
<h2>Hurl Through Hell</h2>
Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.<br><br>
At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
