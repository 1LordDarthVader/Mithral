        <h1>Elder Tome</h1>
        You have made a pact with an entity that holds untold knowledge of the universe, and it has given you a tome bearing only a tiny fraction it's consciousness and its knowledge. In this tome, lost secrets are scrawled in an alien tongue unread by mortal eyes in millennia. As you learn you must write down as much information you gain into in your adventure into the empty pages at the back of this tome so that all the knowledge you gain is also gained by your patron. In return, they reveal the secrets hidden behind the indiscernible scrawling at the front of the book.<br><br>
Knowledge is power. And power, slowly revealed to you, is your reward.
<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
The Elder Tome lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

<h2>The Elder Tome</h2>
At 1st level, your patron has given you a tome into which you must inscribe the knowledge you gain throughout your adventures. The tome also holds great power of its own which can be released in times of need.<br><br>
Whenever you finish a long rest you can prepare up to three spells from any spell list into your elder tome. You can then cast one of the spells you inscribed into the tome using a warlock spell slot. Once you cast a prepared spell, you can't cast that prepared spell again until you finish a long rest. You can change which spells are prepared after you finish a long rest, but the spells you prepare must be of a level you can cast.<br><br>
When you reach 11th level in this class, Spells of 6th level or higher can be prepared using this feature, but they must be of a level that your Mystic Arcanum feature can cast. You can then cast them by invoking your Mystic Arcanum.<br><br>
You can summon and dismiss the elder tome into or out of a harmless pocket dimension as a bonus action. If you later gain the Pact of the Tome feature, the elder tome counts as your book of shadows.
<h2>Destructive Examination</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you learn about your enemies as you destroy them. Whenever you deal damage to a creature with a spell of 1st level or higher, you learn the creature's Damage Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, Damage Immunities, and Condition Immunities.
<h2>Thought Stealer</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can attempt to steal the knowledge of a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As a bonus action, you can force the creature to make an intelligence saving throw. On a failed save they lose one memory of your choice that you know they have such as the location of particular object, or the combination to a safe lock. You gain the knowledge stolen.<br><br>
You cannot steal a memory that the target has had for more than 30 days.<br><br>
Once you use this feature on a creature you cannot do it to the same creature again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Omniscient Burst</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can empower your mind to be able to comprehend all the vast records of knowledge stored inside the tome all at once in order to give yourself a form of divination through near-perfect estimation.<br><br>
You can cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=218">Divination</a> spell at will, without expending material components.
