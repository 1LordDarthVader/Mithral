        <h1>Symbiont</h1>
        Most warlocks make pacts with dead gods and foreign, intangible spirits, but you have assurance of your patron's power, for it dwells within you. You are the host of a symbiotic growth that has fused itself with your body, granting you power and secrets in return for sustenance and protection. This symbiont could be a parasite of unknown magical origin, or a rare and powerful creature that requires a host to remain healthy, or a seed planted by a great tree so old its roots reaches across the planes, space and time itself. It could even be from the remnants of another host of the symbiont, whose death left you as the new carrier of the seed.
<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
The Symbiont lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

<h2>United Survival</h2>
At 1st level, you may use your action to have a life-stealing vine burst from your chest. Make a melee spell attack against an enemy within 15 feet of you. On a hit, the vine stabs into the creature and drains them of vitality. The creature takes magical piercing damage equal to your warlock level, and you regain hit points equal to the damage dealt.<br><br>
Additionally, whenever you fail a death saving throw, the vine automatically lashes out and makes this attack against the nearest hostile creature.<br><br>
After you recover hit points using this feature, you cannot make this attack again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Mind of Thorns</h2>
At 6th level, the seed within you resists all attempts at intrusion. Once per short or long rest when you make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on the saving throw. You can choose to use this feature after you make your roll, but before the DM determines whether the saving throw succeeds or fails. The creature that provoked the saving throw must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or become poisoned until the end of their next turn. While they are poisoned, they are also blinded.
<h2>Cycle of Life</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can fashion a new seed of your symbiont during a short or long rest. Over the course of a 1 minute ritual, you can place this seed upon a dead creature, consuming it. The creature rises as a zombie with 1 hit point.<br><br>
The zombie will seek a path towards a destination you name at the time of this ritual, as if under the effects of the find the path spell. It will ignore any creatures it encounters and will not stop unless it is destroyed. Once the zombie reaches its destination, it will fall to the ground and a sapling will sprout from the corpse. If you create a new seed the previous one ceases to function, and the zombie crumbles to the ground, a lifeless corpse once more.
<h2>Seeds of Destruction</h2>
At 14th level, as an action, or whenever you are reduced to 0 hit points and you fail to recover hit points using your United Survival feature, you can choose to sprout a growth of thorns around you. The area within a 30-foot radius of you becomes difficult terrain as blood-hungry vines spread from you.<br><br>
A creature within the area at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. A target takes 4d6 magical slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Allies make this saving throw with advantage.<br><br>
If created as an action, it lasts until the start of your next turn. If created when you are at 0 hit points, it lasts until you recover 1 hit point, or becomes permanent if you die.<br><br>
This feature can be used once as an action, and once when you are at 0 hit points, and you recover these uses whenever you finish a long rest.
