        <h1>Stormbringer</h1>
        You have made pact with a tempestuous being; born of wind, shrouded in rain, and heralded by thunder. An ancient elemental, powerful storm giant, or perhaps a demigod of disagreeable weather. Most of these patrons are obscure and volatile. What they sought through you may vary, but the magic they grant will prove to be a powerful asset in times of tribulation. Such powers tend to be far better at calling the chaotic power at their disposal than calming it, and many who ride the tempest will find the same is true for them, leaving destruction in their wake.
<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
The Stormbringer lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

<h2>Building Storm</h2>
Starting at 1st level, when you cast a spell of first level or higher on your turn, a storm begins to brew around you. The storm gains Storm Levels based equal to the level of the spell slot used, up to a maximum of 5 or half your Warlock level (rounded up), whichever one is lower. If you cast a spell while the storm is active, the storm level is increased by the level of the spell slot used, up to your maximum Storm Level. While a storm is active, you gain the effect of the storm's current level as well as all lower levels.
<table>
<tr>
<th>Storm Level</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>You can cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=372">Gust</a> cantrip as a bonus action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>You can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on a ranged weapon attack made against a target within 15 feet of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>You are under the effect of levitate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>If a creature ends their turn within 10 feet of you or strikes you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 1d8 lightning damage to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>You gain flying speed equal to your walking speed.</td>
</tr>
</table>
The storm loses 1 level each time you end your turn without casting a 1st level or higher spell. You can prevent the decay of storm by concentrating on maintaining the storm as if it were a spell for a duration of up to 1 minute, provided you aren't concentrating on any other spells. If you lose concentration on your Building Storm, you cannot start concentrating again until you cast another spell or take an action that increases Storm Levels.
<h2>Rolling Thunder</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you learn the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=105">Call Lightning</a> spell. If you cast call lightning by expending a spell slot, your storm level does not decrease while you are concentrating on it. If your Storm Level is 3 or higher, you are considered under &quot;stormy conditions&quot; as per the spell, even if you are indoors.
<h2>Heart of Thunder</h2>
Also at 6th level, whenever you deal damage with the Eldritch Blast cantrip or a weapon attack, you can choose to replace the damage type with lightning or thunder damage.
<h2>Whispering Winds</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can hear a whisper on the winds that tells you where they go what they do. You can predict the weather accurately up to 8 hours away, and know if any weather effect is natural or magical in nature.<br><br>
Additionally, you may hear other things on the winds by way of what they hear; you can cast scrying without expending a spell slot or requiring any verbal or material components, but when cast in this way, your sensor can only hear and not see. A target gets a -5 to the save if they are in a place open to the wind (such as outdoors), and a +5 to a place that the wind could not reach (such as the Underdark).<br><br>
Once you cast scrying in this way, you cannot cast it again until you complete a long rest.
<h2>Everstorm</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can spend an action to start building a storm around you, or increase the storm level by one if you already have a storm.<br><br>
Additionally, while you have a Storm Level of 1 or higher, you can use your action to conjure bolts of lightning as per a 3rd level call lightning spell, treating your Building Storm as the storm cloud.
