        <h1>Machine</h1>
        The source of your magical power is not a patron per se, but a piece of magical machinery attuned to your life force and linked to your body. It grants you enchance physical abilities, and as you better learn to harness its power, it can even form weapons or a suit of armor.
<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
The subclass lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

<h2>Biological Enhancement</h2>
Starting at 1st level, the machine enhances your physical abilities in combat. You gain proficiency with martial weapons and medium armor.
<h2>Technological Knowledge</h2>
Starting at 1st level, your knowledge of the machine grants you insights into certain fields. You have advantage on checks made to recall information about constructs. You also learn the On/Off cantrip. It is considered a warlock spell for you, and does not count against the number of cantrips you know.<br><br>
In addition, the machine can communicate with you in a language that only you, the machine, and the machine's creator (if applicable) can understand.
<h2>Mechanical Armor</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your knowledge of the machine has granted you the ability to manifest magical armor around your body. As a bonus action, you can summon a suit of half plate armor to you. The armor has the following effects:
<ul>
<li>The armor cannot be removed until you use a bonus action to dismiss it.</li>
<li>Weapons are integrated into your armor and you cannot be disarmed of them unwillingly.</li>
<li>You may add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to your Armor Class while you have your armor active.</li>
<li>If the armor is targeted by a dispel magic spell cast at a level equal to or higher than half your Warlock level, rounded down, you must make a Wisdom saving throw against the caster's spell save DC. On a failed save, the armor disappears and you take 2d6 force damage. If this happens, you cannot re-summon the armor for two rounds.</li>
</ul>
You may summon the armor a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once) and regain all expended uses on a short rest.
<h2>Environmental Hardening</h2>
Starting at 10th level, your armor is enhanced to protect you against hostile environments. You no longer need to breathe while it is active, and you are unaffected by dangerous environmental conditions, such as the heat of a desert or the pressure of extreme depths.
<h2>Winged Armor</h2>
Starting at 14th level, the armor you can summon is enhanced with wings. While you have it active, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. The wings have a mechanical appearance, and look similar to your armor.
