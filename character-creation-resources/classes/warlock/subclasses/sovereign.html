        <h1>Sovereign</h1>
        Your patron is a king maker, an emperor-creator, and is the architect behind some of the greatest rulers existence ever has known. Perhaps they were a king of a forgotten line, only appearing before beings considered 'worthy'. Perhaps they were an indescribably ancient sage who has watched over and guided monarchs into the brightest of golden ages and through the blackest of dark ages. Whoever the Sovereign is, this being beckons and yearns for a worthy successor who embodies the chivalric values of their lands.
<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
The Sovereign lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

<h2>Chosen Heir</h2>
Beginning at 1st level, you can delve into reserves of might bestowed by your patron to overcome your enemies. As a bonus action or as a reaction when you would become frightened, you become immune to the frightened condition, gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level, and benefit from the bless spell for 1 minute without requiring your concentration.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Knightly Steed</h2>
At 6th level, you gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill if you do not have it already. Additionally, you can use your action to expend a warlock spell slot to cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=283">Find Steed</a> spell, and you can summon the creature beneath you, automatically riding it.<br><br>
At 13th level, you can cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=282">Find Greater Steed</a> through this feature.
<h2>The Lord's Will</h2>
At 10th level, you can activate Chosen Heir whenever you fail a saving throw that causes you to be charmed, grappled, poisoned, prone, restrained or stunned. When you do so, you automatically succeed on the saving throw.<br><br>
You can activate Chosen Heir this way once, and regain the ability to do so after a long rest. This does not stop you from activating Chosen Heir normally.
<h2>Long Live the King</h2>
At 14th level, your natural lifespan is doubled. Additionally, while under the effects of Chosen Heir, you gain the benefits of the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=670">Shield of Faith</a> spell without requiring concentration and have advantage on Wisdom saving throws.
