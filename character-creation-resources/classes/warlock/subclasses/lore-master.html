        <h1>Lore Master</h1>
        You have made pact with being of ancient knowledge. The actual nature of this being can vary greatly, it can be a Pact with a sentient library, an ancient spirit, or perhaps even an entity such as Gond or Oghma. This is a pact for a Warlock that seeks something beyond simple power, they seek knowledge, ancient and unknown knowledge that has once and will again exist.<br><br>
You can leverage this knowledge to know things that your mortal peers would consider miracles, delve the secrets that others do not even know exist, and, most importantly, perhaps even understand the philosophical mechanics of existence.
<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
The Lore Master lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

<h2>Ancient Secrets</h2>
When you select this Patron at 1st level, you can access the ancient secrets your patron has granted you. By expending a pact magic spell slot of at least one level higher than the spell you want to cast (or a first level spell slot for a cantrip), you can cast a Divination, Transmutation or Abjuration spell from any classes' spell list. It counts as a Warlock spell for you when you cast it this way.<br><br>
You can do this a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and regain all uses of this feature at the end of a long rest.
<h2>Magical Mechanics</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your understand of the mechanics beyond magical effects and the cosmic forces are developed enough that if you see a creature casting a spell, you can use your reaction to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to know what the spell is. If a spell you identify with this check would force you to make a saving throw, you can make that saving throw with advantage.<br><br>
Additionally, your comprehension of magic allows you to access magic beyond your power. You can cast from a Spell Scroll even if the spell isn't on your spell list, and you can add your proficiency bonus to the ability check to successfully cast from a Spell Scroll.
<h2>Single Minded Focus</h2>
Starting at 10th level, when you make a concentration saving throw, if you are concentrating on a Divination school spell, you automatically succeed on the saving throw. If you are concentrating on a spell from another school, you can add your spellcasting modifier to the result.
<h2>Tainted Knowledge</h2>
Additionally at 10th level, the ancient knowledge of your Patron has seeped so deeply into you that they become instinctive. You gain the eldritch invocation Eyes of the Rune Keeper and it does not count against your Invocations Known. If you already have this invocation, you can select either Beast Speech or Eldritch Sight instead.
<h2>Fleeting Omniscience</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can bind the concepts of all spell casting and the world itself together into a single cohesive concept. As a bonus action, you can replace your spellcasting ability modifier with the sum of your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers until the end of your turn. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
