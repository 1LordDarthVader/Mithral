<h1>Blood Lord</h1>

Your patron is an elusive, mysterious creature who thirsts for blood. Perhaps it is a fiendish creature from the nine hells, or a bloodthirsty abomination from the outer planes, or an elder vampire from Shadowfell. In exchange for mighty gifts, it demands ignominious rituals and grisly sacrifices.

<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
The Blood Lord lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

<h2>Village Rites</h2>
At 1st level, your connection to your patron has granted you additional knowledge and abilities. You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill and you can use a dagger as the spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

<br><br>In addition, you learn the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=699">Spare the Dying</a> and <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=765">Thaumaturgy</a> cantrips. They are warlock cantrips for you, and do not count against your number of cantrips known.

<h2>Grim Gifts</h2>
Beginning at 1st level, as a bonus action, you can call upon the power of your dread patron. For 1 minute, or until you become incapacitated or die, you gain the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>You have advantage on saving throws against the frightened condition and against curses and effects that affect your soul or possess your body.</li>
    <li>Whenever you deal damage with a warlock cantrip or a weapon attack, you can choose to deal necrotic damage instead of the normal damage.</li>
    <li>Whenever you regain hit points, you gain additional hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.</li>
</ul>

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Blood Curse</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can punish those who would harm you with an unholy curse. When a creature makes an attack roll against you or an ally within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to your warlock level and is blinded. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not blinded. A blinded creature can repeat its saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns, ending the effect on a successful save.

<br><br>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

<h2>Tainted Blood</h2>
At 10th level, your body becomes altered by the power within your blood. You become immune to disease and the poisoned condition, and you gain resistance to necrotic and poison damage.

<h2>Blood Sacrifice</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to sacrifice your own life force to have the power of your patron explode from your form. When you do so, you immediately drop to 0 hit points, though you are considered stable, and you gain a level of exhaustion. Choose from one of the following effects:

<br><br><strong>Renewal.</strong> Your blood reinvigorates other creatures. You can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your warlock level. Choose any number of creatures within 30 feet of you, not including yourself, and divide those hit points among them. Additionally, any curse, disease, or poison currently affecting the target creatures immediately ends.
<br><br><strong>Defilement.</strong> Your blood bursts outwards. All hostile creatures within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d10 necrotic damage and is cursed for 1 minute. While cursed, a creature suffers from the effects of the bane spell. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't cursed.

<br><br>Once you use an effect granted by this feature, you can't use either effect again until you finish a long rest.
