        <h1>Great Ooze</h1>
        You have met with the fate of many an adventurer or dungeon delver; enveloped by a wandering cube of sentient ooze. You might have escaped death, but became forever altered by the hunger that dwells in the darkness. You might have even sought this entity out, seeking the patrons of elder oozes like Ghaunadaur and Juiblex, who have consumed great knowledge and powers beyond your ken over the centuries from their living prey, and from them too, gained desires beyond mere hunger. Or perhaps you were merely an Oblex spawn; a construct with old memories that remained behind after being separated from your tether.
<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
The Great Ooze lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

<h2>Family of Ooze</h2>
At 1st level, you gain the ability to speak with oozes and communicate simple concepts, even if they can't speak a language. You do not take acid damage that would be caused by a non-hostile ooze touching you.
<h2>Consumed Memories</h2>
At 1st level, you learn to absorb the bodies of the dead and learn from their lives. As an action while standing adjacent to a corpse, you can produce an iridescent acid that consumes the corpse over the course of 1 minute. Once the process has finished, you can reabsorb the acid to gain the memories from the creature's last 48 hours alive.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Cellular Division</h2>
At 6th level, your body becomes more flexible and fluid. Whenever you suffer damage, you can use your reaction to divide into a Medium swarm of Tiny oozes. Your hit points remain the same, and you function as a single unified swarm that occupies the same space as a Medium creature.<br><br>
While in this state, you can't take actions other than the Dash action, your movement speed is halved, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, immunity to acid and poison damage, you don't provoke opportunity attacks, and you can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. You can return to your normal form at will without using an action, provided there is room to do so.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 10th level, you can use this feature at will as an action. Using this feature as a reaction is still limited to once per long rest.
<h2>Acidic Body</h2>
At 10th level, your form is infused with caustic power and you gain immunity to acid damage. Whenever a creature starts its turn in a grapple with you, you can choose to have it take 2d8 acid damage.
<h2>Ooze Assimilation</h2>
Starting at 14th level, your otherworldly nature grants you advantage on all saving throws against being charmed. You also gain the ability to cast the polymorph spell, but the target can only be turned into an ooze. You can cast this spell using a warlock spell slot or without expending a spell slot. When you cast it without expending a spell slot, the spell is cast at its lowest level and you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
