        <h1>Pale Legion</h1>
        You have made a pact with a pale legion. Or more precisely, a pale legion has made a pact with you. 10,000 lost and wandering souls have chosen you as their host. In so doing they grant you great power over life and death and the experience of many lifetimes in exchange for being able to experience existence once again through you.<br><br>
These souls were once people of many different walks of life, each soul within a legion has its own story; though the whole of the legion will be related in some way. On might have once been the citizens of a city that was destroyed by war or disaster. Another might be a grand army that seeks vengeance against a particular enemy from a long ago battle.<br><br>
Though a legion may see you as a means to an end, but they are often benevolent to their hosts as they grant them something they are afraid to let go of.
<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>

<h2>Aura of the Dead</h2>
Starting at 1st level, the souls of the dead can experience life again when they are close to you, though they are invisible to everyone. And though each soul is weak individually, you can use a bonus action gather them all around you, combining their power to create a spectral aura that reaches out to 15 feet around you.<br><br>
Your aura is visible to everyone when in this state, and it gives you the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Creatures of your choice treat your aura as difficult terrain.</li>
<li>You can use any spells or abilities that require you to make melee spell attack, or that have a range of touch, against any creature that is inside of, or adjacent to, your aura.</li>
</ul>
The aura remains active even if you are incapacitated, but disappears if you die or you choose to end it as a bonus action.
<h2>Stories of the Dead</h2>
At 6th level, the thousands of souls that make up a legion contain vast amounts of experience with each soul having its own stories to tell and its own wisdom to share. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can choose up to three skills or tool sets of your choice. Until the end of your next long rest, you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to any rolls made using those skills or tools.
<h2>Corporeal Legion</h2>
At 10th level, your growing bond with the legion allows them to become more and more corporeal, giving them the ability to physically touch the world around them. While your aura is active, you can interact with objects that are within your aura. You can do things as delicate as picking locks, and move things that weigh up to ten times your spell level.<br><br>
Additionally, whenever a hostile creature makes a melee attack against an allied creature that is inside your aura, they must roll a d4 and subtract the amount rolled from their attack as they are grappled and pulled at by the legion's ghosts.
<h2>Rally the Legion</h2>
At 14th level, if your aura is active, you can use an action to call forth the souls of the living and the dead to stand at your side in battle. For the next minute, your aura extends out to 30ft around you. You can then choose up to ten creatures in your aura to gain temporary hit points equal to twice your warlock level. If a chosen creature is unconscious, it is restored to consciousness with 1 hit point before it is given the temporary hit points.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
