        <h1>Archmage</h1>
        Your pact is with an extremely powerful spellcaster, a legendary master of the arcane. Perhaps you have come into possession of a relic of theirs that holds a connection to their essence, or perhaps you have fallen under the tutelage of a demilich. Regardless of how you contact them, such spellcasters are immensely powerful, and are directly connected to the Weave. For your service, they can teach you the deepest secrets of arcana.<br><br>
Arcane beings powerful enough to forge such a pact include Vecna, Elminster, Mordenkainen, Karsus, Iggwilv, Laeral Silverhand, Halaster Blackcloak, and Acererak.
<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
The Archmage lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

<h2>Arcane Storage</h2>
Starting at 1st level, your pact allows you to prepare a spell for later usage. When you finish a long rest, you can choose one warlock spell you know, to a maximum of 5th level. You can cast that spell once without using a warlock spell slot, but cannot cast it otherwise, until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Unbreakable Spell</h2>
When you reach 6th level, if a spell you cast is dispelled, or if you would lose your concentration on a spell before its duration ends, you can use your reaction to maintain concentration on the spell or prevent its dispelling.<br><br>
Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Spell Resistance</h2>
Starting at 10th level, your dealings with the arcane give you a measure of protection from spells. You have resistance to damage from spells.
<h2>Induce Weakness</h2>
At 14th level, as an action, you can weaken a creature you can see within 30 feet and make it more easily influenced and damaged by magic. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failure, the creature becomes vulnerable to damage from spells until the end of your next turn, and has disadvantage on saving throws against spells for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a successful save.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
