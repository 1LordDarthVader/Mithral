<h1>Seer</h1>

You have made pact with a being of ancient knowledge and foresight that sees through time and, perhaps, into different realms. Your patron may be a being of fate itself, said to be nigh omniscient and all-powerful. The actual nature of this being can vary greatly, it can be a Pact with an inscrutable sphinx, an ancient spirit, or perhaps even a sentient tome.

<br><br>You can leverage this pact to forge your own fate, delve the secrets that others do not even know exist, and perhaps even understand the philosophical mechanics of existence.

<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
The Seer lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

<h2>Ancient Secrets</h2>
When you select this Patron at 1st level, you can access the ancient secrets your patron has granted you. By expending a pact magic spell slot of at least one level higher than the spell you want to cast (or a first level spell slot for a cantrip), you can cast a Divination, Transmutation or Abjuration spell from any classes' spell list. It counts as a Warlock spell for you when you cast it this way.

<br><br>You can do this a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and regain all uses of this feature at the end of a long rest.

<h2>Architect of Reality</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your understand of the cosmic forces are developed enough that if you see a creature casting a spell, you can use your reaction to know what the spell is. If a spell you identify with this check would force you to make a saving throw, you can make that saving throw with advantage.

<br><br>Additionally, your comprehension of magic allows you to access magic beyond your own power. You can cast from a Spell Scroll even if the spell isn't on your spell list, and you can add your proficiency bonus to the ability check to successfully cast from a Spell Scroll.

<h2>Seer's Mind</h2>
Starting at 10th level, when you make a concentration saving throw, if you are concentrating on a Divination school spell, you automatically succeed on the saving throw. If you are concentrating on a spell from another school, you can add your spell casting modifier to the result.

<h2>Gifted Sight</h2>
Additionally at 10th level, you gain the eldritch invocation Eyes of the Rune Keeper and it does not count against your Invocations Known. If you already have this invocation, you can select either Beast Speech or Eldritch Sight instead.

<h2>Fleeting Omniscience
Starting at 14th level, you can bind the knowledge of all magic past and future together into a single cohesive concept. As a bonus action, you can replace your spellcasting ability modifier with the sum of your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers until the end of your turn.

<br><br>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.
