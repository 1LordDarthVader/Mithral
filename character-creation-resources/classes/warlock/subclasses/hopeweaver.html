        <h1>Hopeweaver</h1>
        Your patron is a powerful, benevolent entity that wishes to spread happiness and prosperity as far and wide as possible. You have accepted their charge and their power and you now travel the lands bringing the sick to health, feeding the starving till they're full, and bringing a light of hope to those who have none.<br><br>
But you and your patron are not naïve. There will be times where violence is unavoidable and you are given the power to either avoid it, or if pushed too far, to fight back with your own power.
<h2>Expanded Spell List</h2>
The Hopeweaver lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

<h2>Bonus Cantrips</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you learn the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=369">Guidance</a> and <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=317">Friends</a> cantrips. They count as warlock cantrips for you and don't count against the number of cantrips you know.
<h2>Shield of Kindness</h2>
At 1st level, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to give that creature temporary hit points equal to twice your warlock level before any damage is dealt. The temporary hit points last until the end of the target's next turn.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Nearly-Violent Protest</h2>
Starting at 6th level, once per round, when a creature hits you with an attack, you can force them to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, they are pushed 15 feet away from you and knocked prone.<br><br>
At 14th level, this feature can be used twicer per round.
<h2>Benevolence Unbound</h2>
At 10th level, the world is brighter and more positive while you are around. For an area of one mile around you, plants bloom with brighter and more vibrant colors, most wild animals are calm, the weather is nicer, and feelings of dread, fear, hate, and anger are suppressed if not outright banished in most, but not all, sentient peoples.<br><br>
In addition to these effects you can choose which of the following effects to be prevalent while within 100 feet of you. You can change your choice when you finish a long rest.
<ul>
<li>Creatures are immune to disease and are cured of any disease they have when they touch you.</li>
<li>Food regenerates when not being eaten or digested, and sources of clean drinking water never run dry.</li>
<li>Instruments and singing voices sound more beautiful, and their sound carries much farther.</li>
</ul>
If you take a violent or evil action, this feature ceases to function for the next hour unless you were forced to commit the action, and no other non-violent option was possible.
<h2>Avatar of Hope</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can summon an entity that embodies your and your patron's desire to bring hope and happiness to the world.<br><br>
As an action, you can summon your avatar of hope for one minute up to half a mile away. You decide what it looks like, as it comes from your imagination.<br><br>
The avatar is massive in size and can be seen by all creatures within one mile of it, unless their view would otherwise be obstructed, and all normal and magical darkness is banished within that mile as the avatar glows like a small sun. Creatures of your choice are immune to being frightened and charmed while in the light of the avatar and they also regain 15 hit points at the start of each of their turns.<br><br>
You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
