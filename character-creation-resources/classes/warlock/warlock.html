<h3>Pact Magic</h3>
Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.

<h4>Cantrips</h4>
You know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href="../../spells/classes/warlock.html">warlock spell list</a>. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

<h4>Spell Slots</h4>
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
<br><br>
For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

<h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.
<br><br>
The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.
<br><br>
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells.
<br><br>
<strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier<br>
<strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier

<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
You can use an arcane or divine focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

<h3>Signature Cantrip</h3>
<em>Optional Feature</em>
Starting at 1st level, you have a signature cantrip. For most warlocks, this is eldritch blast, but some prefer different magic.
<br><br>
When you gain this feature, choose a cantrip you know that deals damage, other than Eldritch Blast. The chosen cantrip gains the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>When you reach 5th, 11th, and 17th levels, the cantrip gains additional instances that involve individual attack rolls or saving throws, similar to Eldritch Blast</li>
    <li>The Eldritch Invocations that normally apply to Eldritch Blast apply to your chosen cantrip</li>
</ul>
If you have this feature, Eldritch Blast loses such benefits for you.

<h3>Eldritch Invocations</h3>
In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed <a href="./invocation-list.html">Eldritch Invocations</a>, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.
<br><br>
At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.
<br><br>
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

<h3>Pact Boon</h3>
<h4>Pact of the Bastion</h4>
You can use your action to create pact armor around yourself.  Your pact armor takes the form of light plate.  You are proficient with it while you wear it, and if the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the pact armor lacks this requirement for you.
<br><br>
Your pact armor attaches to you and can't be removed against your will.  Your pact armor can be doffed as an action, upon which time it disappears.
<br><br>
You can transform one magic suit of armor into your pact armor by performing a special ritual while you wear the armor.  You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.
<br><br>
You can then dismiss the armor, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact armor thereafter.  You can't affect an artifact or a sentient suit of armor in this way.  The armor ceases being your pact armor if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different suit of armor, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it.  The armor appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

<h4>Pact of the Blade</h4>
You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
<br><br>
Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.
<br><br>
You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.
<br><br>
You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

<h4>Pact of the Cannon</h4>
You can use a bonus action to create a loaded pact firearm in your hand. You can choose the form this firearm takes when you create it from the Firearms page. The weapon cannot be a crank gun or hand cannon, and cannot have any modifications.
<br><br>
You are proficient with it while you wield it. You can use a bonus action to magically create exactly enough ammunition to reload the firearm(s) you are currently wielding, any unused ammunition disappears at the end of your next turn.
<br><br>
This firearm is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact firearm disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the firearm as a bonus action, or if you die.

<h4>Pact of the Chain</h4>
You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.
<br><br>
When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. In addition, the familiar is the same creature type as your patron, rather than a celestial, fey, or fiend.
<br><br>
Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack with its reaction.

<h4>Pact of the Steed</h4>
You learn the Find Steed spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.
<br><br>
When you cast the spell, the steed is the same creature type as your patron, rather than a celestial, fey, or fiend.
<br><br>
Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack with its reaction.

<h4>Pact of the Strings</h4>
Your patron gifts you with a magical instrument that can manipulate the strings of life. In addition, you are granted supernatural playing ability.
<br><br>
You can use your bonus action to create a pact instrument in your empty hand. You can choose the form this instrument takes each time you create it. You are proficient while you play it and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.
<br><br>
In addition, you can soothe those nearby by playing your pact instrument. You gain a single use of the Bardic Inspiration feature. Your Bardic Inspiration die is a d4.
<br><br>
Your pact instrument disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the instrument (no action required), or if you die.
<br><br>
You can transform one magic instrument into your pact instrument by performing a special ritual while you hold the instrument. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the instrument, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact instrument thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient instrument in this way. The instrument ceases being your pact instrument if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different instrument, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The instrument appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

<h4>Pact of the Talisman</h4>
Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that can aid the wearer when the need is great. When the wearer fails an ability check, they can add a d4 to the roll, potentially turning the roll into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.
<br><br>
If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die.

<h4>Pact of the Tome</h4>
Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from <a href="../../spells/spell_list.html">any class's spell list</a> (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.
<br><br>
If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.

<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

<h3>Eldritch Versatility</h3>
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change of focus in your occult studies:

<ul>
    <li>Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Pact Magic feature with another cantrip from the warlock spell list.</li>
    <li>Replace the option you chose for the Pact Boon feature with one of that feature's other options.</li>
    <li>If you're 12th level or higher, replace one spell from your Mystic Arcanum feature with another warlock spell of the same level.</li>
</ul>

If this change makes you ineligible for any of your Eldritch Invocations, you must also replace them now, choosing invocations for which you qualify.

<h3>Mystic Arcanum</h3>
At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.
<br><br>
You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
<br><br>
At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

<h3>Eldritch Master</h3>
At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
