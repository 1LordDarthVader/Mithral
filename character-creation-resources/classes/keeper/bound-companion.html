<h1>Bound Companion</h1>

<p>You use the rules presented here when creating your companion.</p>
<p>Your companion is a Small or Medium creature (your choice) with a base walking speed of 30 feet. If mounted, it continues to act independently, not as a controlled mount.</p>
<p>You generate your companion's ability scores using the following numbers: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8. You assign each of these numbers to an ability score of your choice.</p>
<p>Your companion can be one of many creature types. Select one of the following types: aberration, beast, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, giant, monstrosity, ooze, plant, or undead.</p>
<p>Your companion is proficient in Charisma saving throws. Additionally, choose one ability score other than Charisma. Your companion gains proficiency in saving throws using the chosen ability.</p>
<p>Your companion is proficient in two skills of your choice, and can speak the languages you know.</p>
<p>Finally, select two traits from the list below to give your companion a feeling uniquely its own. Choose carefully. Once created, your companion's features cannot be changed.</p>

<p>Your companion can move through small holes, narrow openings, and cracks small as 1-inch wide without squeezing.</p>

<p>Your companion has blindsight with a range of 30 feet.</p>
<h2 id="toc4"><span>False Appearance</span></h2>
<p>Choose an object or kind of surface, such as a puddle, loose sand, uneven stone, a plant, or a statue. While your companion remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from that object or surface.</p>
<h2 id="toc5"><span>Keen Senses</span></h2>
<p>Your companion has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on two of the following senses of your choice: hearing, sight, or smell.</p>
<h2 id="toc6"><span>Lurker</span></h2>

<h2 id="toc7"><span>Resistance</span></h2>
