<h1>Keeper</h1>
Keepers and their companions are a living gate between the magical and the mundane, defined by their bond to each other and the covenant they form. Wielding esoteric magic, they exert their will on the world by commanding the tiny unseen spirits and connections that permeate the multiverse, drawing on that power to summon otherworldly beings, bind the wills of others, discover hidden secrets, and make their voices heard.

<h2>Class Features</h2>
As a keeper, you gain the following class features
<h3>Hit Points</h3>
<strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per keeper level<br/>
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br/>
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per keeper level after 1st
<h3>Proficiencies</h3>
<strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields<br/>
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br/>
<strong>Tools:</strong> None<br/>
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Constitution, Charisma<br/>
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Animal Handling, Arcana, History, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, and Religion
<h3>Equipment</h3>
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
<ul>
    <li>(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</li>
    <li>(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) three daggers</li>
    <li>(a) leather armor or (b) scale mail</li>
    <li>An druidic focus and an equipment pack</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bound Companion</h3>
You have completed a ritual, binding yourself and a spirit together through a occult compact.  You create your companion using the <a href="./bound-companion.html">bound companion rules</a>.
<br><br>
If your bound companion is ever slain, the connection between you is tested. You take necrotic damage equal to twice your character level. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way, and reduces your hit point maximum by an amount equal to the damage taken (to a minimum of 1) which lasts until you finish a long rest.
<br><br>
If you finish a long rest while your bound companion is slain, your bond inevitably draws you back together. At the end of the long rest, your companion reforms near to you, having gained the benefits of a long rest, in a manner appropriate to its nature. A fire spirit could be reborn in a bonfire, while a ghost might simply arrive with a cold wind.
<h3>Occultist's Seal</h3>
The binding placed upon your companion grounds it in reality, tying it to the material world. This more physical presence grants it a number of benefits.
<br><br>
Your companion obeys your commands as best it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.
<br><br>
Your companion's anchoring in this world is fledgling. As a result, it can't attack until you reach 3rd level in this class.
<br><br>
Your companion has features and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own.
<br><br>
Your companion gains no benefit from armor or weapons, whether or not it is physically capable of using them. Your companion has a natural armor class of 12 + your proficiency bonus.
<br><br>
For each keeper level after 1st, your companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly. Your companion's Hit Dice are d8s, regardless of its size. When your companion is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws as a player character would.
<br><br>
Your companion's level is equal to your keeper level for the purpose of spells and features like polymorph and true polymorph.
<br><br>
Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature from this class, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.
<br><br>
You decide your companion's alignment and ideal. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the the tables below to determine its traits and flaws. Its bond is always &quot;I must protect my keeper. We are greater together than alone.&quot;

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>Flaw? What flaws?</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<h3>Gate of Disguise</h3>
Choose a Small or smaller beast. Your companion can use its action to polymorph into that beast, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it carries is absorbed or carried by the new form (its choice). While polymorphed, its size and speed are replaced by those of the new form, and it can't attack. It otherwise retains its statistics.
<br><br>
Your companion's disguise resembles it in some way. For example, a monstrous horned wolf might take the form of an unusually ferocious dog.
<h3>Gate of Rest</h3>
Your companion can retreat to a pocket dimension, a private domain of your creation. As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your companion. It disappears into this domain, where it awaits your call. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause your companion to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.
<br><br>
Your companion leaves this domain if you die, and can't return unless you are resurrected.
<h3>Awakened Sight</h3>
When you reach 2nd level, your eyes open, ripples of magic and intent now visible to your sight. When you make an Arcana, Investigation, Perception, or Survival check, you can add half your spellcasting ability modifier (rounded up, minimum of 1) to the result.
<br><br>
Starting at 6th level, you instead add your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1).
<h3>Spellcasting</h3>
<a class="breadcrumb" href="../../spells/classes/keeper.html">Keeper Spell List</a><br><br>

By 2nd level, you've earned the attention of the world around you, and established yourself as a force of change.
<h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
The Keeper table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your keeper spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
<br><br>
You prepare the list of keeper spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the keeper spell list. When you do so, choose a number of keeper spells equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your keeper level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
<br><br>
You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of keeper spells requires time spent bonding with the spirits surrounding you: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for your keeper spells, since their power comes from your ability to command the world around you.
<br><br>
<strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier<br/>
<strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier
<h4>Ritual Casting</h4>
You can cast a keeper spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your keeper spells.
<h3>Gate of Battle</h3>
Starting at 3rd level, your companion has grown in power, further grounding itself, and can now attack.
<br><br>
Choose one or two of the following damage types: acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, piercing, poison, psychic, radiant, slashing, or thunder. When a feature uses your companion's damage type, you use one of those damage types (your choice).
<br><br>
Your companion has two natural weapons, which it is proficient with and can use to make melee weapon attacks. These weapons might take the shape of claws, powerful muscles, conjured weapons, or elemental blasts. Your companion can add its Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier to their attack and damage rolls, and they deal 1d6 of your companion's damage type on a hit. In addition, one of these natural weapons gains a benefit from the options on the Companion Attacks table.

        <th>Attack</th>
        <th>Benefit</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Impact</td>

        <td>The weapon gains the reach property.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ranged</td>
        <td>The weapon can be used to make ranged weapon attacks (range 20/60).</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<h3>Spirit Covenant</h3>
At 3rd level, you define the seal binding you and your companion together, and the gateway you form between the mortal world and the spiritual. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and then again 5th, 7th, 11th, and 18th level.

<ul>
<li><a href="./subclasses/covenant-of-the-legion.html">Covenant of the Legion</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/covenant-of-the-vessel.html">Covenant of the Vessel</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/covenant-of-unity.html">Covenant of Unity</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Covenant Spells</h4>
Each covenant has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the covenant description. Once you gain access to a covenant spell, you always have it prepared. Covenant spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
<br><br>
If you gain a covenant spell that doesn't appear on the keeper spell list, the spell is nonetheless a keeper spell for you.
<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
<h3>Practitioner's Font</h3>
Starting at 6th level, your companion's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and ignore resistance to damage of your companion's damage type.
<br><br>
Additionally, during a short rest, you can call on the bond between you and your companion, summoning it even from death. At the end of the short rest, your companion reforms near to you with half its maximum hit points, having gained the benefits of a short rest, and can immediately spend Hit Dice to recover hit points.
<br><br>
Once you call on your companion with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
<h3>Gate of Travel</h3>
Beginning at 10th level, you can ride the bond between you and your companion like a wave. As a bonus action while your companion is within 120 feet of you, you can teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it, or teleport it to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. Alternatively, you can both teleport, swapping places. You don't need to see your companion to teleport using this feature.
<br><br>
You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
<h3>Witch Gate</h3>
By 14th level, your companion is a gate to the magical world, and you are the key. You gain one 5th-level spell slot, which you can use to cast your keeper spells.
<br><br>
At higher levels, you gain additional spell slots: one 6th level spell slot at 17th level, and one 7th level spell slot at 20th level. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
<h3>Retribution</h3>
Starting at 15th level, when you or your companion is reduced to 0 hit points, the other can retaliate in fury, demanding aid from nearby spirits. If they do so, the retaliator immediately regains hit points equal to your keeper level + your spellcasting ability modifier, and for 1 minute, the first creature it hits with an attack on each of its turns takes an extra 2d8 damage of your companion's damage type.
<br><br>
Once you or your companion uses this feature, it can't be used again until you finish a long rest.
<h3>World Gate</h3>
By 20th level, you are a gate to the material world, and your companion is the key. While your companion is alive, you do not age. Additionally, if you die while your companion still lives, the connection between you returns you to the world of the living; if your companion finishes a long rest while you are dead, you can return to life, reforming your body near to your companion, having gained the benefits of a long rest. You can reform your body as a younger version of yourself, if you wish.
<br><br>
If a spell, such as raise dead, has the sole effect of restoring you to life, the caster can cast the spell on your companion as though it were your corpse.
