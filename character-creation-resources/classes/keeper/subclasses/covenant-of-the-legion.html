        <h1>Covenant of the Legion</h1>
        Keepers of this covenant command such a presence that their will is enough to overwhelm the spirits of the world around them. When these legionnaires walk, the wind is at their back, their way is clear, and their pace is swift as they follow their path to victory, their most loyal companion and follower always by their side. They speak with the voice of a conqueror, and the universe listens.

<h2>Hearthkeeper</h2>
When you reach 3rd level, you learn to speak with the spiritual denizens of an area. You can spend 10 minutes entreating or ordering these spirits, burning simple offerings, or otherwise commanding the attention of the world around you.<br><br>
If you do so, you learn one fact of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area within 1 mile of you:
<ul>
<li>Frequently visited buildings and places of business</li>
<li>Historically significant events</li>
<li>Powerful aberrations, celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead</li>
<li>Safe sources of food, water, and places to rest</li>
</ul>
Mortals and spirits experience life in fundamentally different ways. In offering their wisdom, the spirits' advice may be cryptic, spoken like a prophecy, or conveyed through potentially disturbing dreams and visions.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Sworn Protector</h2>
By 3rd level, your companion is your faithful servant and protector. When a creature your companion can see attacks you, your companion can use its reaction to move up to its speed towards the attacker, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll if it ends this movement within 5 feet of the attacker.
<h2>March of the Legion</h2>
Beginning at 5th level, your companion can attack twice, instead of once, whenever it takes the Attack action on its turn.
<h2>Unseen Serfdom</h2>
At 7th level, you gain access to the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=801">Unseen Servant</a> spell. You always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.<br><br>
Additionally, when you cast unseen servant, you can create a number of additional servants equal to half your keeper level. When you cast unseen servant in this way, each servant has a Strength score equal to the number of unseen servants under your command (maximum Strength score of 12), and you can mentally command any or all of the servants when you use your bonus action to command a servant, issuing the same command to each one.<br><br>
Once you cast unseen servant in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Oathbound Guardian</h2>
Starting at 11th level, your companion is your devoted guardian. When you use your Sworn Protector feature, your companion can make a melee attack against the attacker as part of the same reaction.<br><br>
Additionally, while your companion is within 5 feet of a hostile creature, that creature has disadvantage on any attack roll targeting you.
<h2>Demesne</h2>
By 18th level, you can perform a ritual to claim ownership of a location no larger than 500 feet on a side, such as a section of forest, a manor, a castle, or other area, establishing it as your demesne. To perform the ritual, you must spend at least 24 consecutive hours within the area without resting, falling unconscious, or being reduced to 0 hit points. During the ritual, any creature within 1 mile of you is made aware of your claim and the consequences of the ritual. If you successfully complete the ritual, you claim the area as your demesne.<br><br>
Within your demesne, you can shape reality to your will. You can use your action to manipulate an area you can see within your demesne no larger than a 20-foot cube, destroying solid structures, raising or depressing land, changing the weather and temperature, manifesting sounds or smells, or altering the material of a structure or surface - such as changing a stone wall to one of wood, ice, or flesh. If you manipulate an area to cause harm, each hostile creature within the area must make a Charisma saving throw against your keeper spell save DC. A creature takes 4d8 damage of a type of your choice on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br>
If you claim another demesne, your lose ownership of your former demesne, and any changes you made within are slowly undone over the course of a week. Anything created by this feature vanishes when it leaves your demesne, and any changes made to an object are rapidly undone if it leaves your demesne.
