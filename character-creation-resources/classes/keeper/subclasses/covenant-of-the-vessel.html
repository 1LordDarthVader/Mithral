        <h1>Covenant of the Vessel</h1>
        Every keeper treads a measure in the world of the mystical. Some, however, go further, truly joining with the magical world. Called vessels, these keepers cut away fragments of their self, the bedrock of their identity, and fill the gaps with spirits kin to their companion. These vessels are imbued with wild, electrifying power, but must remain vigilant, or risk losing themselves to the spirits they invite within.

<h2>Burning the Candle</h2>
At 3rd level, the spirits invited within change you, making you restless, agitated, and just a little inhuman. You cannot sleep, magically or otherwise, and no longer need to, though you can still be knocked unconscious. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you can spend all 8 hours doing light activity, such as pacing and keeping watch.
<h2>Spirit Riding</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, your will is steeled, strong enough to withstand assault from within.<br><br>
While within 60 feet of you, your companion can use its action to beckon spirits of its nature to enter your body, imbuing you with a portion of their strength through a practice called riding. These spirits remain for 10 minutes. Your Spirit Riding ends early if you die or if you dismiss it (no action required). Your companion can't use this feature while you're Spirit Riding.<br><br>
While Spirit Riding, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Whenever you hit a creature with a weapon attack on your turn, you can push the creature up to 5 feet away from you and immediately move up to half your speed towards an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.</li>
<li>Immediately after you take damage, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).</li>
<li>You cannot be frightened. If you are frightened when you begin Spirit Riding, the effect is suspended while you are Spirit Riding.</li>
<li>You ignore the effects of any levels of exhaustion.</li>
</ul>
The first time you use this ability, you suffer no adverse effect. Each time you use this feature again before you finish a short or long rest, you suffer one level of exhaustion.
<h2>Extra Attack</h2>
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
<h2>Hollowed Heart</h2>
By 7th level, your harrowed spirit can consume fragments of the dead. By spending 1 minute within 5 feet of a creature's corpse, you can learn what skill and tool proficiencies the creature possessed, what languages it spoke, and its type.<br><br>
When you use this feature, you can also choose to harvest fragments of its spirit. If you do so, you gain proficiency in two skills or tools of your choice, chosen from those the creature possessed in life, which remain until you harvest fragments of another creature's spirit. You can replace one or both of these selections with languages the creature spoke. If the creature did not speak a language, you can instead communicate with and be understood by any of its kind.
<h2>Soul Frenzy</h2>
Starting at 11th level, the spirits within you scream at the slightest provocation. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack while Spirit Riding, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the damage of the attack if that creature has damaged you or your companion since the end of your last turn.
<h2>Spirit Vault</h2>
Starting at 18th level, your body is animated by the spirits held within. You ignore the effects of the first five levels of exhaustion. In addition, while Spirit Riding, having 0 hit points doesn't knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points.<br><br>
Additionally, when your Spirit Riding ends, you can open the vault within your soul and release a hurricane of hungry spirits. Each creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw against your keeper spell save DC. A target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage is devoured whole. You regain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier for each creature devoured in this way. If your Spirit Riding ended early because you died and the spirits devour a creature, you are returned to life with 1 hit point.<br><br>
Once you open the vault, you can't open it again until you finish a long rest.
