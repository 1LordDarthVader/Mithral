        <h1>Covenant of Unity</h1>
        The bond between Keeper and companion typically implies a measure of servitude on the companion's part. This is not always the case. For some, the bond is much more intimate, and the line between the two halves is blurred. These merged beings, often called unions or fusions, embody the relationship between each partner, their mind and body shaped by the interplay between their halves.

<h2>Unity</h2>
At 3rd level, your power over connections grants you the ability to become one with your companion. You can use your action while touching your companion to unify with it, merging into a single creature. Your bodies join together, but you retain your class features and other statistics. Your companion becomes a part of your body; it is incapacitated, has a speed of 0, and cannot be targeted by any attack, spell, or harmful effect.<br><br>
While unified, you have resistance to all damage, and each time you take damage, your companion takes the same amount of damage. In addition, whenever you make an ability check, you can make the check using your companion's statistics, rather than your own.<br><br>
For the duration, you gain the benefit of your companion's traits, including its senses and speeds. If your companion has a flying speed, you can't use it while unified until you reach 9th level in this class. If your companion is larger than you, you grow to its size — from Small to Medium, for example.<br><br>
Additionally, you manifest your companion's natural weapons. You are proficient with them, and you can use your companion's statistics when you attack with them. When you use the Attack action with these natural weapons on your turn, you can make one attack with them as a bonus action.<br><br>
Your unification lasts for a number of hours equal to half your keeper level. You and your companion then revert to your separate forms, appearing in the nearest unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of you, unless you expend another use of this feature. It ends early if you or your companion choose to end it (no action required), are reduced to 0 hit points, or die.<br><br>
You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest. Beginning at 11th level, you can use this feature three times between rests.
<h2>Kindred Spirits</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, while you and your companion are on the same plane of existence, you can each communicate with the other telepathically. You don't need to see each other to communicate in this way.
<h2>Equilibrium</h2>
Beginning at 5th level, you and your companion can deal an extra 1d6 damage of your companion's damage type to one creature you hit with an attack on each of your turns. While unified, you can deal this extra damage twice on your turn.<br><br>
When you reach 11th level in this class, this extra damage increases to 2d6.
<h2>Harmony</h2>
At 7th level, you gain the ability to strengthen the connection between yourself and another creature. As an action, you can force a creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw, which it can choose to fail. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 1, it is unaffected.<br><br>
On a failed save, the target is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, you and the target can communicate telepathically, can sense each other's emotional state, and have advantage on all Wisdom and Charisma checks made to interact with each other. You and the target don't need to share a language to understand each other.<br><br>
On a successful save, or if you or your allies do anything harmful to the target, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.<br><br>
The effect ends early if you or your companions do anything harmful to the target, or if you use the feature again.
<h2>Synthesis</h2>
Starting at 11th level, when you or your companion unify, you can expend one spell slot to renew yourselves in your new form. Roll 2d8, plus 2d8 for each slot level higher than 1st. You restore hit points equal to the total, which you can divide as you choose between you and your companion.
<h2>Fusion</h2>
At 18th level, you become a master of bonds. You can use your Unity feature an unlimited number of times.<br><br>
Additionally, your mastery over connections allows you to truly join with another being. As an action while you aren't unified, you can fuse with a willing creature you touch, becoming a single creature. When you fuse with a creature, you add your hit point maximums and current hit points together, using a shared pool.<br><br>
While fused, you and the creature retain your class features and proficiencies, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the other. In combat, you each roll your own initiatives and act on your own turns. You use the higher of your ACs, speeds, ability scores, and sizes, any spell or effect that targets one of you targets both of you, and if either of you succeed on a saving throw, you both succeed.<br><br>
The fusion lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you or the creature dies or chooses to end it (no action required), if the pool of hit points is reduced to 0, or if you unify with your companion. You and the creature then revert to your separate forms, appearing in the nearest unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of you and dividing the remaining hit points in the shared pool between you and the creature as you choose.<br><br>
Once you fuse with another creature, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
