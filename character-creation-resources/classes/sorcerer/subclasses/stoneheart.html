        <h1>Stoneheart</h1>
        Your blood comes from a steadfast lineage, touched by the elemental forces of the earth itself. Be it the blood of ancient dwarves first formed from stone or from a dao lineage, your heart beats more steadily than others.<br><br>
Blessed with natural resilience and command over the ground you stand on, most Stoneheart sorcerers are solid and deliberate in both action and thought, slow to anger and often given to taking a long term point of view. However, if stirred to action, they are as stout and unwavering as rock.
<h2>Stoneheart Magic</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Spells table. Each of these spells counts as an arcane spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of arcane spells you know.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an evocation or transmutation spell from the arcane or warlock spell list.

<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with simple and martial weapons.
<h2>Heart of Stone</h2>
When you choose this origin at 1st level, you can draw upon the earthen magic within you harden your physical form for a limited time. Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to take on an elemental form, your physical form becomes covered in rock and stone, and you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>If you are not wearing armor, you armor class is equal to 13 + your Constitution modifier.</li>
<li>When you cast a spell, you can use your Strength modifier in place of your spellcasting ability modifier.</li>
<li>When you make a weapon attack, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier in place of your Strength modifier.</li>
</ul>
This transformation lasts for one minute, or until you end it as a bonus action or fall unconscious. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Stone Aegis</h2>
Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can expend 2 sorcery points to create a visible aura of protection on yourself or another allied creature you can see within 60 feet on you. The shield lasts for 1 minute, until you use it again, or until you are incapacitated.<br><br>
Once per turn, when the creature takes bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage, the aegis absorbs some of the damage from the attack and empowers you with it. The damage the protected creature takes is reduced by 1d6, and you store that power in yourself.<br><br>
Your next damage roll that deals bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage is bolstered by the power you stored, and you add your stored number of d6s to the roll. You can store a maximum of two hits (2d6 total), and once the maximum is reached you must expend the stored power before the aegis can absorb more damage.<br><br>
The maximum number of hits you can reduce the damage of and store energy from before expending it increases to three (3d6) at 11th level, and to four at 17th level (4d6).
<h2>Extra Attack</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action.
<h2>Stonewalk</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you gain a borrowing speed of 15 feet, allowing you to travel through the earth. You can pass through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone, leaving no hole behind you. If you would end your turn inside of earth or stone, you are pushed back to where you entered the earth or stone's surface.
<h2>Unity of Stone</h2>
Starting at 18th level, whenever you transform with your Heart of Stone feature, you gain temporary hit points equal to your sorcerer level. The temporary hit points disappear when your transformation ends.<br><br>
Additionally, your Stone's Aegis no longer requires sorcery points to use, and when you use it to protect someone other than yourself, you can create another aegis on yourself as part of the same bonus action. The maximum number of hits these shields can store are counted together as part of the same total.
