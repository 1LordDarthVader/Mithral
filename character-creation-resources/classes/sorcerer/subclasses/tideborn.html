        <h1>Tideborn</h1>
        A lineage tethered to the deepest of depths, you trace your powers back to the heartbeat of the ocean. Perhaps your ancestor was born below the waves and ascended in search of the world above, or perhaps they were the survivor of a shipwreck, having struck a bargain with one of the great gods below the disappearing light. Perhaps even you, yourself, were born amidst the aftermath of a devastating tsunami, your feet treading water long before they touched the ground.<br><br>
Tideborn feel the push and pull of the ocean much akin to their own heartbeat. They understand the incessant, relentless rhythm of their ancestry unlike any other. They may venture inland in search of fame, glory, or an escape from their coastal calling, but conscious or not, they will eventually respond to the pull of a homebound tide.
<h2>Sea Magic</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Sea Spells table. Each of these spells counts as an arcane spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of arcane spells you know.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an evocation or a transmutation spell from the arcane or warlock spell list.

<h2>Born of Water</h2>
When you choose this origin at 1st level, your natural affinity for the sea grants you several gifts. You gain the ability to breathe underwater, and you have a swim speed of 30 feet. If you already have a swimming speed, your swimming speed is increased by 10 feet.
<h2>Ebb And Flow</h2>
Starting at 1st level, your body moves in time with the rhythm of the tides, allowing you to imbue your magic with powerful momentum. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that successfully affected a creature other than yourself, you gain advantage on your next attack roll made against a different creature. This advantage lasts until the end of your next turn, and if you hit with this attack against a Large or smaller creature, you can choose to knock it up to 10 feet away from you. This distance increases by 5 feet at your 6th and 11th level in this class.
<h2>Cascading Torrent</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your attunement with the tide improves and your command over its unrelenting force increases. Whenever you forcibly move a creature, that creature takes 1d8 cold damage for every 10 feet it is moved (up to a maximum of 3d8), as a torrent of water bombards it along its trajectory. A creature can take this damage once on a turn.<br><br>
Additionally, whenever you forcibly move a creature, you can spend 1 sorcery point to move them in any horizontal direction of your choosing.
<h2>Riptide Core</h2>
Starting at 14th level, the tides will answer your call no matter where you may be. As as action, you create a swirling mass of water that violently circles around you in a 30 foot radius for 1 minute. This area is considered difficult terrain. Any creature that starts it's turn in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw. On a failed save you can force the tides to carry them up to 30 feet in any direction within the area of effect.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>King of the Tide</h2>
At 18th level, you exist in pure harmony with your aquatic heritage; you move as the sea does, fluid and unstoppable. When you move on your turn you can expend 1 sorcery point to take on a watery form until the end of your turn.<br><br>
While in this watery form, you have resistance to fire damage and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from non-magical weapons. Additionally, you can move through any enemy's space but can't willingly end your move there. You can move through any space that is at least 3 inches in diameter and do so without squeezing.<br><br>
If your Riptide Core feature is active, creatures within the area of effect must make a Strength saving throw against your Sorcerer spell save DC or fall prone and be dragged along with your movement.
