        <h1>Deathtouched</h1>
        Your innate magic comes from a past encounter with death. Most often, this origin is traced back to surviving an attack from an undead, such as a vampire's bite, a ghost's possession, or a specter's life drain. Or, it could have originated from an imperfect revival or near-death experience. Regardless of the way you attained this dark magic, it now dictates your life and greatly augments your power.
<h2>Deathtouched Magic</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Deathtouched Spells table. Each of these spells counts as an arcane spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of arcane spells you know.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an enchantment or a necromancy spell from the arcane or warlock spell list.

<h2>Necrotic Affinity</h2>
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your body becomes imbued with dark power. Your hit point maximum is increased by 1, and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
<h2>Memories of the Fallen</h2>
Also at 1st level, you gain the ability to access the memories of the deceased. By performing a 1 minute ritual on a corpse, you can gain insight into how that creature died. If you already witnessed that creature's death, you instead gain another random memory from that creature, as determined by your DM. This feature can only be used once per corpse.
<h2>Ghostly Body</h2>
At 6th level, your body can slowly fade into invisibility. If you remain still for 1 minute while in dim light or darkness, you become invisible until you move, enter bright light, or use an action, bonus action, or reaction.<br><br>
Alternatively, you can use your bonus action and spend 1 sorcery point to activate this feature without waiting a minute, causing you to immediately become invisible.
<h2>Incorporeal Figure</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you have the ability to become temporarily incorporeal. As a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 2 sorcery points to become incorporeal, gaining the ability to move through objects as if the objects were difficult terrain, and you become immune to the grappled and restrained conditions. For the duration, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and your speed is increased by 15 feet.<br><br>
The incorporeal effect ends at the end of your next turn. If you are inside an object when the effect ends, you are ejected to the nearest empty space and take 1d10 force damage.
<h2>Possession</h2>
At 18th level, you gain the ability to take control of another creature's body. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to attempt to possess a creature of size Large or smaller within 5 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC or be possessed for up to 1 hour. On a success, you then disappear, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body, but not its awareness. While you are possessing a creature, you can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and you retain your alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You otherwise use the possessed target's statistics, but you doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features such as spellcasting and extra attack, or proficiencies such as skills and armor.<br><br>
The possessed creature can repeat the saving throw whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on a success. You may also end the effect using your bonus action. A target is immune to this feature for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.
