        <h1>Phoenix Spark</h1>
        Your power draws from the immortal flame that fuels the legendary phoenix. You or your ancestors perhaps rendered a phoenix a great service, or you were born in its presence. Whatever the cause, a shard of the phoenix's power dwells within you. That power is a mixed blessing. Like the mythical creature, you can invoke fiery energy and gain the ability to cheat death itself. This power comes at a cost. The fire within you seethes, demanding to be unleashed. You sometimes find yourself absentmindedly feeding fires. You can't bear to allow a fire to sputter out. You feel most comfortable while holding a lit torch or sitting in front of a campfire.
<h2>Phoenix Magic</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Phoenix Spells table. Each of these spells counts as an arcane spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of arcane spells you know.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an evocation or a transmutation spell from the arcane or warlock spell list.

<h2>The Spark</h2>
When you choose this Origin at 1st level, you have a spark within that burns more brightly when you use your magic. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals fire or radiant damage, the spark ignites and begins to blaze.<br><br>
Upon casting the spell, you regain hit points equal to the level of the spell slot you expended. At the start of subsequent turns, you regain that amount minus 1 hit point per turn elapsed until it would restore 0 hit points, at which point the spark becomes dormant. If you are reduced to 0 hit points, the spark immediately goes dormant.<br><br>
If you cast a spell that sets the spark ablaze while it is already ablaze, you regain hit points equal to the level of the spell you just cast and you can reset the amount of hit points the spark restores to the level of that spell if it is higher than what the spark would otherwise restore at the start of your next turn.
<h2>Flames Ablaze</h2>
Starting at 6th level, the spark within you strengthens, and you draw more deeply from its power. While the spark within you is ablaze, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>You can add your spellcasting ability modifier to one damage roll of spells that deal fire or radiant damage.</li>
<li>As a reaction to taking fire or radiant damage, you can gain resistance to that instance of damage, and increase the level of your spark by 1.</li>
</ul>
<h2>In Flames Reborn</h2>
Starting at 14th level, when you ignite the spark within or while it is ablaze you can use a bonus action and expend 2 sorcery points to make the fire surge forth from you. Flames consumes your physical body leaving you as a winged shape of fire until the start of your next turn. You can extend the duration of this form for by expending an additional 2 sorcery points each round. In this form, you gain the effect of the Investiture of Flame spell with following additional benefits:
<ul>
<li>You have a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover.</li>
<li>You become immune to the poisoned condition and to disease.</li>
<li>The amount of hit points you regain from your Spark feature is doubled, however it still lasts for the same number of rounds.</li>
<li>Your Spark does not go dormant if you reach 0 hit points.</li>
<li>When you return to your normal form, you gain one level of exhaustion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phoenix Unleashed</h2>
Starting at 18th level, as an action, you can take the form of a phoenix for a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the phoenix, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You do not gain its Legendary Actions or Legendary Resistances. You can't cast spells, speak, nor take any action that requires hands. The equipment you wear merges into your new form and has no effect until you leave the form.<br><br>
When the duration ends or you are reduced to zero hit points, the phoenix's Fiery Death and Rebirth feature is triggered, leaving behind your normal form instead of an egg. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.
