<h1>Wretched Bloodline</h1>

With every promise made to a fairy, contract signed with a devil, and pact with the unquiet dead, there's a chance someone doesn't keep their end of the bargain. The vengeance of immortal beings lasts much longer than one lifetime, and the lingering magic of these curses can affect the mortal's descendants.

<br><br>These inherited magical afflictions may manifest as a plague, deformity, or aversion to the sun. In such families, a child may be born that learns to master the latent magic within their inherited curse, turning their bloodline's bane into a personal boon-these sorcerers are known collectively as the Wretched.

<h2>Wretched Magic</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Wretched Spells table. Each of these spells counts as an arcane spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of arcane spells you know.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a conjuration or an evocation spell from the arcane or warlock spell list.

<h2>Bad Luck Charm</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you have mastered the ability to temporarily cast a small fragment of your curse onto another. You can use a bonus action to choose a creature you can see within 30 feet. The chosen creature has disadvantage on the next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you spend 1 sorcery point to use it again.

<h2>Blood Ties</h2>
At 1st level, your senses easily attune to the supernatural forces that caused your inherited affliction. You know the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=201">Detect Evil and Good</a> spell and can cast it without expending a spell slot. This spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you but does not count against your number of spells known. Once you cast this spell without expending a spell slot, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

<br><br>In addition, choose one of the following creature types as the being who cursed your ancestor: fey, fiend, or undead. While you are concentrating on the detect evil and good spell, creatures of the chosen type have disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you cannot be charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.

<h2>Wretched Curse</h2>
Also at 1st level, you suffer from a curse inherited from an ancestor who failed to uphold their end of a bargain with an otherworldly power. Choose one of the following curses that was passed down to you.

<br><br><strong>Hulking.</strong> Your ancestor was cursed with a hulking frame. You have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) ability checks made to move quietly. In addition, your maximum hit points increase by 1 and increase by 1 again each time you gain a level in this class. Finally, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
<br><br><strong>Nocturnal.</strong> Your ancestor was cursed to shun the light of day. You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) ability checks made to see while you are in sunlight. In addition, you have darkvision out to a distance of 120 feet and can see through magical darkness within that range.
<br><br><strong>Plaguebearer.</strong> Your ancestor was cursed with physical symptoms of a plague. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) ability checks made against humanoid creatures who are not blinded. In addition, you are immune to disease and have resistance to necrotic damage.

<h2>Share the Burden</h2>
At 6th level, you learn the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=75">Bestow Curse</a> spell. This spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. When you cast the spell, you can choose to cast it by spending 3 sorcery points instead of a spell slot. If you cast the spell using sorcery points, its range changes to 60 feet for that casting and your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.

<h2>Terrifying Visage</h2>
Beginning at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to adopt the terrifying visage of the being who cursed your ancestor for 10 minutes. During this time, you can use an action on each of your turns to cause each creature who can see you within 30 feet make a Wisdom saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failure, a creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

<br><br>In addition, while you have adopted the terrifying visage, you gain an additional benefit based on the creature type chosen with your Blood Ties feature.

<br><br><strong>Fey.</strong> You can use a bonus action to teleport up to 30 feet in any direction.
<br><br><strong>Fiend.</strong> You have resistance to cold and fire damage.
<br><br><strong>Undead.</strong> When you take damage that isn't radiant, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by an amount equal to half your sorcerer level. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

<h2>Vengeful Summons</h2>
Beginning at 18th level, your magic has become powerful enough that you can call and command a servant of those that cursed you. Choose one of the following creatures as a representative for your curse based on the choice you made with your Blood Ties feature: lamia or troll (fey only), barbed devil or incubus/succubus (fiend only), ghost or wraith (undead only). You can use an action and spend 5 sorcery points to summon your chosen creature. The creature appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet, and disappears when it drops to 0 hit points, you use this feature to summon another creature, or after 10 minutes have passed.

<br><br>Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no action on your part), telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn attacking any creature within reach.
