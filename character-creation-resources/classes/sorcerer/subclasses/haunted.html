<h1>Haunted</h1>

Unlike many other sorcerers, the circumstances of your birth were mundane and you have no arcane inheritance passed down from strange ancestors. Instead, you gained your sorcerous powers after you managed to survive an experience that left you on the brink of death. Since that experience you've had a preternatural sense for danger and a ghostly companion that either can't or won't leave you alone. Some Haunted, as sorcerers who share your origin are called, develop cordial relationships with their phantom, while others find their spectral companion to be a relentless nuisance.

<h2>Haunted Magic</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Ghostly Spells table. Each of these spells counts as an arcane spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of arcane spells you know.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a conjuration or an evocation spell from the arcane or warlock spell list.

<h2>Phantom Companion</h2>
At 1st level, you learn the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=281">Find Familiar</a> spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.

<br><br>When you cast the spell, you can only choose the form of a specter, which becomes your phantom companion. Instead of a celestial, fey, or fiend this familiar's creature type is undead.

<br><br>As an action, you can command your phantom companion to turn invisible until it attacks or you cast a spell through it. While invisible, it leaves no physical evidence of its passage, so it can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment or objects it is holding remains visible.

<br><br>Additionally, at 3rd level, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make its Life Drain attack with its reaction.

<h2>Sixth Sense</h2>
Starting at 1st level, when you make a Dexterity ability check to determine initiative, you gain a bonus to the roll equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

<h2>Strength of Spirit</h2>
At 6th level, your bond to the specter summoned by your Phantom Companion feature empowers it further. You gain the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>Your specter's maximum hit points increase by four times your level in this class.</li>
    <li>Your specter can deliver spells of any range, not just touch. Apart from this change, it follows all the normal rules of casting a spell through your familiar.</li>
    <li>When you use your action to cast a spell, you can use a bonus action on the same turn to command your specter to use its Life Drain attack against a creature within range of your choice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deathly Pallor</h2>
Also at 6th level, you gain resistance to necrotic damage. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals damage, you can choose to change the damage type dealt to necrotic.

<h2>Phantom Possession</h2>
At 14th level, as an action you can direct your phantom companion to attempt to possess and enter a humanoid of your choice within 5 feet of your phantom. Creatures immune to the charmed condition are immune to this feature. When you do, the creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or be possessed by your phantom for 1 minute. During this time your phantom cannot be affected by spells or abilities, take actions, or interact with in any way.

<br><br>While the target is possessed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are within 100 feet. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability, taking the Dodge action if it has not used its action already.

<br><br>Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Charisma saving throw against the possession. If the saving throw succeeds, the possession ends and your phantom companion reappears in the closest unoccupied space.

<br><br>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short rest.

<h2>Become Death</h2>
At 18th level, you can transmute your physical form into a spectral one when you near death. When you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you drop to 1 hit point instead and gain temporary hit points equal to half your maximum hit points. At the start of each of your turns, you lose 5 temporary hit points and all creatures of your choice within 30 feet take 5 necrotic damage. While you have any temporary hit points granted from this feature, you have resistance to all damage, a fly speed of 30 feet, and can move through creatures and objects provided you end your movement in an unoccupied space.

<br><br>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
