        <h1>Arcane Soul</h1>
        Some people are born inherently magical, recognized from childhood for their unusual nature. With such a potent source of magic imbued within them, strange, unpredictable events occur in their wake. Many paths can lead to such a fate. An alchemical attempt to raise the dead could leave the subject forever changed, implanted with a magical heart overflowing with power. Or, a creature could be born with an elemental spark within them, suffusing them with ceaseless energy.<br><br>
However it got there, within every arcane soul sorcerer is a pulsing source of neigh boundless power that they struggle to control.
<h2>Arcane Soul Spells</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Arcane Soul Spells table. Each of these spells counts as an arcane spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of arcane spells you know.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a divination or an evocation spell from the arcane or warlock spell list.

<h2>Raw Magic</h2>
When you choose this origin at 1st level, you learn the Prestidigitation cantrip and you can cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=203">Detect Magic</a> spell at will, without expending a spell slot.
<h2>Overcharged Magic</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you gain resistance to force damage. You also gain the Empowered Spell metamagic option, or another metamagic if you already have it. When you modify a spell that deals damage with your Metamagic options, you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to one damage roll of that spell.
<h2>Arcane Fuel</h2>
At 14th level, when you cast Dispel Magic and remove a magical effect, you regain up to two expended sorcery points or spell points (your choice) as you draw in the remnants of the broken magic.<br><br>
Additionally, you can use a reaction when you would take force damage to absorb the magical energy of the attack. Instead of taking damage, you regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage of the attack, before resistances.<br><br>
Once you regain hit points with this ability a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, a long rest is needed before you can do so again.
<h2>Strength Beneath the Skin</h2>
At 18th level, you can tap the power that surges through your blood to replenish your magic. As a bonus action, you can expend a hit die and regain Sorcery Points equal to the number rolled + your spellcasting ability modifier.<br><br>
Once you do this, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.
