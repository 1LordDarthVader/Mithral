        <h1>Elemental Soul</h1>
        Your innate magic manifests in elemental surges. You are your element, and your element is you.
<h2>Elemental Specialty</h2>
Choose an element from among the following list. It affects which element your features apply to. In addition, you learn a cantrip determined by your choice, which is considered an arcane spell for you.

<h2>Elemental Magic</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Elemental Spells table. Each of these spells counts as an arcane spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of arcane spells you know.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an evocation or a transmutation spell from the arcane or warlock spell list.

<h2>Heart of the Elements</h2>
At 1st level, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals damage of your elemental type, elemental magic erupts from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to take damage of your elemental type equal to half your sorcerer level (minimum of 1).
<h2>Elements in the Veins</h2>
At 6th level, you gain resistance to your elemental type of damage. In addition, spells you cast ignore resistance to your elemental type of damage.
<h2>Elemental Soul's Fury</h2>
Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal damage of your elemental type to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level, and ignores resistance to your elemental type of damage.
<h2>Elemental Body</h2>
At 18th level, you gain immunity to your elemental type of damage. In addition, any spell or effect you create ignores resistance to your elemental type of damage and treats immunity to your elemental type of damage as resistance to your elemental type of damage.
