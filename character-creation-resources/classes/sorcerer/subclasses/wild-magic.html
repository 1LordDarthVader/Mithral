        <h1>Wild Magic</h1>
        Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it came to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.
<h2>Wild Magic</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Wild Spells table. Each of these spells counts as an arcane spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of arcane spells you know.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an evocation or a transmutation spell from the arcane or warlock spell list.

<h2>Wild Magic Surge</h2>
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, roll a d20.<br><br>
If you roll a 1 on the d20, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.<br><br>
If you do not roll a 1 on the d20, the threshold for a wild magic surge increases by 1. Once you have caused a wild magic surge, the threshold resets back to 1.
<h2>Tides of Chaos</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.<br><br>
At any time after you use this feature, if you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you regain the use of this feature.
<h2>Bend Luck</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.
<h2>Controlled Chaos</h2>
At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.
<h2>Spell Bombardment</h2>
Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per turn.
