        <h1>Hellspawn</h1>
        Somewhere in your bloodline, one of your ancestors made a pact with a powerful spirit of flame and predation. This creature may be an elemental, fiend, fey, or something else primal and otherworldly honored with ritualistic immolation and sacrifices of meat and metal.<br><br>
With smoke and cinders pouring from your hands with each spell you cast and a layer of ash gradually creeping over your body, you are the incarnation of a smoldering ember thrown upon a dry forest.
<h2>Hellspawn Magic</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Hellish Spells table. Each of these spells counts as an arcane spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of arcane spells you know.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a conjuration or an evocation spell from the arcane or warlock spell list.

The Armor of Agathys spell is modified for you. It deals fire damage rather than cold damage.
<h2>Born of Ember</h2>
At 1st level, you can speak, read, and write Inferna.<br><br>
Additionally, whenever you are below half your hit point maximum, a thin layer of ash and char engulfs your skin and embers erupt from your hands. While you have this layer, you can cast the produce flame cantrip as a bonus action.
<h2>Burning Fury</h2>
Starting at 6th level, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with the produce flame cantrip, the burning fury empowering your attack surges through the creature, turning its vital organs to ash and granting you temporary hit points equal to twice your spellcasting ability modifier.<br><br>
Additionally, you can spend 1 sorcery point during your turn when you are below half your hit point maximum to cause the ash upon your skin to harden. Until the start of your next turn, you have resistance to fire and necrotic damage and your AC is 17 if it was lower.<br><br>
At 14th level, you gain immunity instead of resistance.
<h2>Wraith of Cinders</h2>
At 14th level, your spark has grown to a flame, burning black with dark power. Any time you would inflict fire damage, you can choose to inflict necrotic damage instead, and vice versa.<br><br>
Additionally, your ashen form allows you to move with unnatural ease, disintegrating and reforming with each step you take. You ignore difficult terrain, and you can move through any space at least 6 inches wide without squeezing.
<h2>The Devil's Bargain</h2>
At 18th level, your power over the ancient and primal magics of flame and darkness is without peer.<br><br>
As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to launch yourself skyward in a pillar of fire and smoke before crashing down at a location that you can see within 60 feet of your point of origin, unleashing a hellish blast of fire and cursed power at a creature within 5 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC, taking 6d10 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br>
If the target is slain by this attack, it is consumed instantly by flame, and the ashes coalesce into a hell hound. The hell hound obeys your orders without question and acts during your turn. You can't have more than two hell hounds at a time from this feature. Creation of a third hell hound destroys the oldest one still alive. Each hell hound remains in your service until slain or until the third dawn after it was summoned, at which point it disintegrates into ash.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
