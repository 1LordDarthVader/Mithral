        <h1>Imperial Bloodline</h1>
        There is power in king's blood. Your innate magic comes from your royal ancestry. Whether you are a far flung cousin of a great house, the child of a deposed prince, a secret bastard denied legitimacy, or the rightful heir to a kingdom, your bloodline is that of kings and emperors. You might be unaware of your lineage and of the source of your power, or perhaps you have always known yourself to be the true inheritor of a throne now held by usurpers.
<h2>Imperial Magic</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Imperial Spells table. Each of these spells counts as an arcane spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of arcane spells you know.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an abjuration or an enchantment spell from the arcane or warlock spell list.

<h2>Ancestral Homeland</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency in your choice of Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion. You also learn a language of your choice and gain proficiency with a tool of your choice. You have advantage on Intelligence (History) checks to recall information about culture, people, and politics.
<h2>Commanding Voice</h2>
Also at 1st level, your bloodline has granted you a voice fit for a ruler, one that makes your enemies tremble and puts fire into the hearts of your allies. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that has verbal components, you can grant temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier to a friendly creature other than yourself within 30 feet of you, which last for 1 minute.
<h2>Majestic Presence</h2>
Starting 6th level, you gain an aura of majesty that steels the hearts and minds of those who follow you. When you or a friendly creature within 30 feet of you makes a Charisma or Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant them advantage on the saving throw before the results of the roll is revealed.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Royal Decree</h2>
Also at 6th level, when you cast a spell with verbal components, you can spend 1 sorcery point to imbue your voice with magic. You can perform the verbal components regardless of any obstruction to your ability to speak, such physical restraints or the silence spell. If the spell involves speaking to a creature, that creature being deafened or not sharing a language with you does not prevent the creature from hearing and understanding you.
<h2>Bend the Knee</h2>
Beginning at 14th level, when a creature fails the initial saving throw imposed by one of your spells, you can choose for them to also become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
<h2>Ancestral Title</h2>
At 18th level, you adopt a title befit a legendary monarch, and gain permanent benefits associated with that title. Choose one of the following benefits:
<ul>
<li><strong>The Great.</strong> Increase one ability score of your choice by 2. Your maximum for that score is now 22.</li>
<li><strong>The Kind.</strong> You learn the Sanctuary and Protection from Evil and Good spells, which count as arcane spells for you. You can cast them at will, without expending spell points.</li>
<li><strong>The Terrible.</strong> You are immune to being frightened and you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that are frightened of you.</li>
<li><strong>The Wise.</strong> Choose three of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for checks made with them.</li>
</ul>
