        <h1>Fallen Celestial</h1>
        Your power comes from an ancestor that once called the heavens their home. For some reason however, they fell from grace and became a fallen celestial. Their actions since have led to your birth and as you became aware of your magical talent you noticed that there was a touch of the divine in it; as well as a touch of the damned.
<h2>Fallen Magic</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Fallen Celestial Spells table. Each of these spells counts as an arcane spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of arcane spells you know.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a necromancy or a restoration spell from the arcane or cleric spell list.

<h2>Power of Duality</h2>
Also starting at 1st level, you know the Chill Touch or Pacify cantrip, which is considered an arcane spell for you and does not count against the number of cantrips you know.
<h2>Dual Halo</h2>
At 1st level, you can use a bonus action to summon a dark and divine halo to floats above your head for 1 minute. It gives you the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>You gain resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.</li>
<li>You can use a bonus action to allow a creature you can see to make a saving throw against an affect that allows a saving throw to be made to end the effects.</li>
<li>You can use a bonus action to cause a creature that can see you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell DC. Unless they succeed, they are frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Once a creature suffers this effect, it has advantage on this saving throw for the next 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
Once you summon your dual halo you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Purify / Putrefy</h2>
At 6th level, you can use an action and expend two sorcery points in order to cast the Consecration or Desecration spell.<br><br>
In addition, allied creatures that receive healing while within 30 feet of you regain additional hit points equal to half your sorcerer level. Hostile creatures that receive healing in the same range reduce the amount of hit points they regain by the same value.
<h2>Dark Wings</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you gain a pair of dark feathery wings which give you a flying speed of 30 feet.
<h2>Divine Menace</h2>
At 18th level, when you use your Dual Halo feature, your flying speed is increased by an additional 30 feet and creatures that are frightened of you within 60 feet must spend their action to drop their weapons and their movement to move as far away from you as possible.
