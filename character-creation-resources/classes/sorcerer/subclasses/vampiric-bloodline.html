        <h1>Vampiric Bloodline</h1>
        Your innate magic comes from a dark part of your ancestral past. You have a direct familial connection to a vampire, and its power has shown itself most in you. It is not a curse that you have, but the blood in your veins that connects you to them.<br><br>
Having this origin is a secret that is often kept secret at all costs as many folk will point at those with vampiric blood in them and cry evil. Indeed many who trace their lineage to such creatures turn to evil in order to survive in a world that despises them. This is their choice, however, and you can choose to become what you want.<br><br>
The power of your bloodline may mark you as evil, but it does not control you.
<h2>Vampiric Magic</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Vampiric Spells table. Each of these spells counts as an arcane spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of arcane spells you know.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an enchantment or an illusion spell from the arcane or warlock spell list.

<h2>Vampiric Ancestry</h2>
From 1st level, when you choose this subclass, your Vampiric ancestry grants you the benefits that are shown below.
<ul>
<li>You can cause a creature to re-roll a successful saving throw made against being charmed by sorcerer spells you cast. You can't do this to the same creature again for seven days.</li>
<li>You don't need to sleep in order to gain the benefits of a long rest. Instead you can spend four hours doing simple nonstrenuous tasks such as reading a book, writing a letter, or painting a picture.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ancestral Regeneration</h2>
At 1st level, your bloodline gives you incredible regenerative power. You have a pool of regeneration represented by a number of d6's equal to your sorcerer level.<br><br>
As a bonus action, you can spend a number of those dice equal to your Charisma modifier or less(Minimum 1). You regain hit points equal to the total amount rolled.<br><br>
You regain all expended dice when you finish a long rest. If you are in direct sunlight, roll d4s instead of d6s.
<h2>Misty Escape</h2>
Starting at 6th level, when reduced to 0 hit points you are not rendered unconscious but instead you (along with all the items you are wearing) transform into a cloud of mist. While in mist form you are immune to all damage, can take no actions other than to fly with a speed of 30 feet, and must make death saving throws as normal. At the end of your next turn, your body reforms and you become unconscious if you still have 0 health.<br><br>
Once this happens, it can't happen again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Night Walker</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you are always under the effects of the Spider Climb spell.
<h2>Lineage Scion</h2>
Starting at 18th level, you age very slowly. For every five years that pass, you age only one year.<br><br>
Also, you can use your Ancestral Regeneration feature on your turn while you are unconscious or in mist form. If you do this, your turn ends afterwards and you roll d4 instead of d6s for the healing.
