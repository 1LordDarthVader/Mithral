        <h1>Fey Lineage</h1>
        Your magic is influenced by the changeable nature of the feywilds, and your powers shift with the seasons themselves.
<h2>One With Nature</h2>
Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Nature skill and you learn the Druidcraft cantrip.
<h2>Seasonal Spells</h2>
At 1st level, choose a season to attune yourself to. You know the spells on your attuned season's list, which don't count against the number of spells you can know. They count as arcane spells for you. You can change the season you are attuned to when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Ecological Embodiment</h2>
At 6th level, your chosen season grants the following benefits:
<ul>
<li><strong>Autumn.</strong> When you cast gust, the distance you can push a creature increases up to 5 x your proficiency bonus feet. A target knocked prone or pushed by your sorcerer spells takes bludgeoning damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.</li>
<li><strong>Winter.</strong> Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you moves at least 10 feet with their movement, you can spend 1 sorcery point as a reaction to force it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or fall prone.</li>
<li><strong>Spring.</strong> When you cast a seasonal spell of 1st-level or higher, you regain hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. You can spend 1 sorcery point to also grant this same benefit to one other creature within 30 feet of you.</li>
<li><strong>Summer.</strong> When you cast produce flame, you can hurl it up to 60 feet, rather than 30, and you can conjure flames in both hands. If you do, a target takes extra fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier when you hit with your attack.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Season's Zenith</h2>
At 14th level your seasonal magic flares with the intensity of the peak of your season.
<ul>
<li><strong>Blessing of the Equinox (Autumn/Spring).</strong> Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can either grant twice your sorcerer level + your spellcasting ability modifier amount of temporary hit points (Autumn) or restore that number of hit points (Spring), divided as you choose among creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you. Affected creatures are also cured of any diseases or poisons affecting it.</li>
<li><strong>Blessing of the Solstice (Winter/Summer).</strong> Whenever you or a creature within 30 feet of you would take cold or fire damage, you can use your reaction grant resistance to that creature against the damage until the end of your next turn. In addition, once on each of your turns when you make an attack or cast a spell that deals cold damage (Winter) or fire damage (Summer), you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to one damage roll of that attack or spell.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Avatar of the Seasons</h2>
Starting at 18th level, you can spend 6 sorcery points as a bonus action to magically transform. For 1 minute, you gain the benefits of each season's Ecological Embodiment feature, and you can cast 1st or 2nd-level spell from any season's spell list at its lowest level without expending a spell slot. For the duration, you also gain a flying speed of 60 feet, but you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.
