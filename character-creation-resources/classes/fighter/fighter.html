<h3>Know Your Enemy</h3>
Starting at 3rd level, you can measure the martial prowess of other creatures in comparison to your own skill. As an action, choose a creature you can see within 60 feet. You then learn if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regards to one of the following attributes of your choice:
<ul>
    <li>Armor Class</li>
    <li>Current or Total Hit Points</li>
    <li>Dexterity Score</li>
    <li>Exploits Known</li>
    <li>Fighter Class Levels</li>
    <li>Proficiency Bonus</li>
    <li>Strength Score</li>
</ul>
Once you learn something about a creature, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.
<br><br>
When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use this feature as either an action or bonus action on your turn.
<h3>Martial Archetype</h3>

<h3>Martial Versatility</h3>
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to fighters. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.
<h3>Extra Attack</h3>
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
<br><br>
When you reach certain levels in this class, the number of attacks you can make as part of the Attack action increases; at 11th level (3 attacks) and at 17th level (4 attacks).
<h3>Action Surge</h3>
Starting at 6th level, you can push yourself beyond mortal limits, if only for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action as part of that current turn. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Upon reaching 20th level, you can use this feature twice per short or long rest, but only once per turn.
<h3>Indomitable</h3>
Beginning at 9th level, when you fail a saving throw, you can choose to re-roll that saving throw, possibly turning a failure into a success. Once you turn a failure into a success, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.
<br><br>
As you gain levels in this class you gain additional uses of this feature; at 13th level (2), and 17th level (3). However, you can only use this feature once per saving throw.
<h3>Relentless</h3>
Upon reaching 20th level, your skill in battle rivals that of legendary heroes. When you begin your turn with no Exploit Dice remaining, you regain one expended Exploit Die.
