        <h1>Swordsage Archetype</h1>
        Swordsage, blade master, sword saint; expert warriors who dedicate their lives to the art of war have had many names throughout history. Only drawing their weapon when they are prepared to kill, a Swordsage will only strike down their foe when necessary. They are always looking to improve their technique, mastering ever more impressive martial skills.<br><br>
Legends say that these reclusive masters take only one apprentice in their lifetime, passing on everything they know to a single student. Other folk tales tell of elusive sages who only take on the most promising young warriors. Whatever the origin of your skill, you are a Swordsage of legend, and your title inspires disbelief, fear, jealousy, and wonder.
<h2>Student of the Blade</h2>
In your study of the sword you have mastered other skills adjacent to swordplay. At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in either Acrobatics, Insight, Intimidation, or Performance.<br><br>
In addition, when you adopt this Archetype you learn one additional Martial Exploit. This Exploit can be from any list, including Archetype exclusive Exploits, and it doesn't count against your total number of Exploits Known.<br><br>
You learn an additional Exploit in this way when you reach 7th level in this class, and again when you reach 18th level.
<h2>Battle Trance</h2>
At 3rd level, you learn to enter a Battle Trance. This Trance grants you improved abilities, provided you are not wearing heavy armor, using a shield, or wielding a heavy weapon.<br><br>
As a bonus action, you can expend an Exploit Die to enter a Battle Trance for 1 minute. It ends if you are incapacitated, or if you don a shield, heavy armor, or a heavy weapon. While in your Battle Trance you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Your movement speed increases by 10 feet.</li>
<li>You gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down).</li>
<li>You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks.</li>
<li>Once per turn, when you roll an Exploit Die for an Exploit you can roll twice and take the higher of the two rolls.</li>
<li>As a reaction when you are forced to make a saving throw, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Heightened Reflexes</h2>
You have honed your reflexes in pursuit of martial perfection. At 7th level, you gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws, and you can add your proficiency bonus to initiative rolls.
<h2>Improved Battle Trance</h2>
You have mastered the Battle Trance of the Swordsage. Starting at 10th level, when you roll initiative, you can enter your Battle Trance without expending an Exploit Die.
<h2>Legendary Swordsage</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you become a whirlwind of deadly steel while in your Battle Trance. Once per turn, while you are in your Battle Trance, you can use an Exploit you know, rolling a d6 in place of expending an Exploit Die.<br><br>
At 18th level the d6 from this feature becomes a d8.
