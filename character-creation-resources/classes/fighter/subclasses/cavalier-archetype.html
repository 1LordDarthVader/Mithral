        <h1>Cavalier Archetype</h1>
        The archetypal cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.
<h2>Bonus Proficiency</h2>
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.
<h2>Born to the Saddle</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you're not incapacitated.<br><br>
Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.
<h2>Unwavering Mark</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.<br><br>
While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.<br><br>
In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attack's weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter level.<br><br>
Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Warding Maneuver</h2>
At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you're wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Hold the Line</h2>
At 10th level, you become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.
<h2>Ferocious Charger</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you can run down your foes, whether you're mounted or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.
<h2>Vigilant Defender</h2>
Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature's turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.
<h2>Cavalier Exploits</h2>
<h3>Cavalier's Training</h3>
When you make a Charisma (Persuasion), Wisdom (Insight) or Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know if you succeed or fail.
<h3>Mounted Strike</h3>
When you hit a creature with an attack from atop a mount, you can expend an Exploit Die, adding it to the damage of your attack and forcing it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is knocked prone.
<h3>Skilled Rider</h3>
Whenever a mount you are riding makes an ability check or saving throw, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to the result of the roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know if you succeed or fail.
