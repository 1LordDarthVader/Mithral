        <h1>Dancer Archetype</h1>
        Fighting isn't just a means of defeating one's opponent—not to you. Fighting is an art form; a performance; a dance. The dancer is the master of movement: poised and graceful. The battlefield is their stage and their enemy is an audience to be beguiled.<br><br>
As a dancer, you may have studied under the tutelage of other such masters or trained for years as an acrobat in a circus or a jester in a king's court, adapting your art to compliment your martial prowess.
<h2>Bonus Proficiency</h2>
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in either the Acrobatics or the Performance skill. If you are already proficient in both skills, you instead gain proficiency with one of the following tools: calligrapher's supplies, painter's supplies, disguise kit, or any musical instrument.
<h2>Unarmored Defense</h2>
With a graceful pirouette or a feinting dodge; a dazzling smile or a playful wink, you can avoid incoming attacks with speed and cunning, and armor would only slow you down.<br><br>
Beginning at 3rd level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.
<h2>Flourishing Finale</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you can end your turn with a beautiful flourish. If you have moved at least 40 feet since the start of your turn without moving to the same space twice, you can make an additional attack (no action required).<br><br>
This attack uses your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. The damage die for this attack is a d6 if you have moved at least 40 feet, a d8 if you have moved at least 50 feet, or a d10 if you have moved at least 60 feet.<br><br>
After you make this attack, your turn immediately ends.
<h2>Expertise</h2>
At 10th level, choose either Acrobatics or Performance. Alternatively, choose one of the tools specified in the Bonus Proficiency feature. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen proficiency.
<h2>Fast Movement</h2>
Starting at 10th level, your movement speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing armor.
<h2>Dazzling Display</h2>
Starting at 15th level, when a creature makes an attack against you, you can briefly distract them. Before the attack roll is made, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack still hits, you can reduce the damage by an amount equal to twice your Charisma modifier.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once) and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Dancing Master</h2>
At 18th level, you master the art of martial dancing. Even when you miss your mark, you can quickly shift into a new position and try again.<br><br>
Once on each of your turns when you miss a creature with a weapon attack, you can immediately move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks from the creature and choose to make another weapon attack against a different creature as part of the same action.
<h2>Dancer Exploits</h2>

</ul>
<h3>The Whirling Wind</h3>
