        <h1>Marksman Archetype</h1>
        While every fighter can draw a bow or hurl a javelin, those who train to become Marksmen dedicate themselves to perpetually improving their accuracy and precision with ranged weapons of all types. Most often, this deadly skill is backed up by an unmistakable swagger and unshakable confidence. Relying on their innate talents and signature grit, there are few challenges a true Marksman cannot overcome.
<h2>Elite Training</h2>
When you adopt this Archetype at 3rd level, your specialized training has enhanced your reaction times. Whenever you make a Dexterity check or saving throw, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can do so after you roll, but before you know whether you succeed or fail.
<h2>Steady Aim</h2>
You can quiet your body so as to fire with deadly accuracy. Starting at 3rd level, if you haven't moved during your turn, you can use your bonus action to Steady Aim, granting you the following benefits until the end of your current turn:
<ul>
<li>Your movement speed is reduced to 0 feet.</li>
<li>Until you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you have advantage on all ranged weapon attack rolls.</li>
<li>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a ranged weapon, you can re-roll the die. You must use this new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cunning Shot</h2>
Your experience as a Marksman has trained you to react to danger at a moment's notice. Beginning at 7th level, you can add your proficiency bonus to your Initiative rolls.<br><br>
You have also learned to identify and exploit even the smallest weak points in your enemy's defenses. Your attacks with ranged weapons ignore resistance to piercing damage.
<h2>Reposition</h2>
Starting at 10th level, when you use Second Wind, your speed increases by 10 feet and opportunity attacks against you are made at disadvantage until the end of your current turn.
<h2>Reliable Shot</h2>
You make even impossible shots with ease. Beginning at 15th level, you ignore disadvantage from your weapon's long range.<br><br>
In addition, once per turn, when you have advantage on a ranged weapon attack, you can forgo advantage and make one additional ranged weapon attack against the same target.
<h2>Legendary Marksman</h2>
Your marksmanship is supernatural in its precision. Starting at 18th level, when you use Steady Aim the benefits last for 1 minute, and you have advantage on all ranged weapon attacks for the duration. This effect only ends early if you move more then 10 feet in one turn, or you are incapacitated.
<h2>Marksman Exploits</h2>
<h3>Marksman's Gaze</h3>
When you make a Wisdom (Insight), Wisdom (Perception), or Intelligence (Investigation) check, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know if you succeed or fail.
<h3>Piercing Shot</h3>
When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to deal additional damage equal to the creature equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die.
<h3>Precision Shot</h3>
When you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature, you can expend on Exploit Die to add it to your attack roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know whether your attack hits or misses the target.
<h3>Volley</h3>
As an action, you can expend an Exploit Die to fire a volley of projectiles at a point you can see within the normal range of your weapon. Creature within 5 feet of that point must make on a Dexterity Saving throw. They take piercing damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die on a failure, and half damage on a success. You must have enough ammunition to hit each target in the area in order to use this Exploit.
