        <h1>Witchblade Archetype</h1>
        A witchblade is a martial practitioner who has chosen to mix arcane power into their fighting maneuvers. They don't cast spells as an individual art separate from the swinging of their weapons. Instead, they meld the two practices together to create a devastating whirlwind of steel intermixed with sudden casts of low power, but potent, spells that easily hand the advantage to the person using them.
<h2>Blade-Spells</h2>
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn Blade-spells, a rapid-fire form of spell craft that is designed to be used in tandem with swinging a weapon.
<h3>Blade-Spells</h3>
You know all the blade-spells which are detailed at the end of this subclasses description. Unless stated otherwise, you cast blade-spells by exchanging one of the attacks you make when you take the attack action.<br><br>
You can only cast one blade-spell per turn, and you can cast up to 4 blade-spells, regaining any expended uses of these spells when you finish a short or long rest. You gain an additional use of your blade-spells when you reach 7th level, and another at 15th level.<br><br>
Though they do not use spell slots, blade-spells count as 0th level spells for the purpose of countering or dispelling.
<h3>Blade-Dice</h3>
Whenever you cast a blade-spell, it will ask you to roll a set of blade dice. You do this by rolling 2d4. You gain a benefit or deal damage based on what you rolled.
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
Some of your blade-spells require your target to make a saving throw to resist the blade-spell's effects. The saving throw DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Melee spell attacks use your normal attack modifier.
<h2>Magical Mastery</h2>
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. If you already have it, you add twice your proficiency bonus to Arcana checks.
<h2>Blink Dancer</h2>
At 7th level, you can shift into and out of existence for a moment. Anytime you cast a blade-spell, you can move teleport up to 10 feet before you cast it.
<h2>Greater Blade-Dice</h2>
Starting at 7th level, when you roll your blade dice, you roll d6s instead of d4s. At 10th, you roll d8s, then d10s at 18th level.
<h2>Spell Eater</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you can consume magical energy off of a spell cast at you. If you are forced to make a saving throw to avoid the effects of a spell that was cast using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, and you succeed on the save, you regain one use of your blade-spells.
<h2>Blade-Spells</h2>
<h3>Blast</h3>
Make a melee spell attack. If the attack hits, roll your blade dice. The target takes force damage equal to the amount rolled and is pushed back 15 feet and knocked prone.
<h3>Displace</h3>
Make a melee spell attack. If it hits, the target must make a charisma saving throw. On a failed save they are teleported to a space you can see within 15 feet.
<h3>Deflect</h3>
If you are hit with a weapon or spell attack, you can use your reaction to roll your blade dice and reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to what you rolled.
<h3>Distract</h3>
Roll your blade-dice. You create an illusory copy of yourself that suddenly moves in a random direction. Each hostile creature your are within melee range of must make an intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, they must spend their reaction attacking the illusion. If they do, they take psychic damage equal to the amount you rolled.
<h3>Flash</h3>
Choose a creature within 10 feet of you and roll your blade dice. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On failed save they take radiant damage equal to the amount your rolled and are blinded until the end of your next turn.
<h3>Reflect</h3>
If you are hit with a melee weapon or melee spell attack, you can use your reaction to cause the attacking creature to make a wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they instead make the attack against the closest creature within reach other than you or itself, randomly choosing if there is more than one.
