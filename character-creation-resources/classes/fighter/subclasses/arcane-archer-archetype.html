        <h1>Arcane Archer Archetype</h1>
        An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of their most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.
<h2>Arcane Archer Lore</h2>
At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature – typical for practitioners of of this elven martial tradition. You choose to gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you choose to learn either the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=590">Prestidigitation</a> or <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=235">Druidcraft</a> cantrip.
<h2>Arcane Shot</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can imbue your shots with arcane energy. These function as Exploits, which are listed at the bottom of this page. You learn an additional exploit at 3rd level, which must be from among the Arcane Archer exploits.
<h2>Magic Shot</h2>
At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse projectiles with magic. Whenever you fire a nonmagical projectile from a ranged weapon, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the projectile immediately after it hits or misses its target.
<h2>Curving Shot</h2>
At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant projectile toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with a magic projectile and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.
<h2>Ever-Ready Shot</h2>
Starting at 15th level, your magical archery is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot remaining, you regain one use of it.
<h2>Empowered Arcane Shot</h2>
Starting at 18th level, all of your Arcane Archer Exploits deal extra damage equal to three rolls of your Exploit Die.
<h2>Arcane Archer Exploits</h2>
<h3>Banishing Shot</h3>
You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, its speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
<h3>Beguiling Shot</h3>
Your enchantment magic causes this projectile to temporarily beguile its target. The creature hit by the projectile takes extra psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.
<h3>Bursting Shot</h3>
You imbue your projectile with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. The projectile detonates after your attack. Immediately after the projectile hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take force damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die each.
<h3>Enfeebling Arrow</h3>
You weave necromantic magic into your projectile. The creature hit by the projectile takes extra necrotic damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.
<h3>Grasping Shot</h3>
When this projectile strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the projectile takes extra poison damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Exploit save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.
<h3>Piercing Shot</h3>
You use transmutation magic to give your projectile an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the projectile fires forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The projectile passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the projectile, plus extra piercing damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.
<h3>Seeking Shot</h3>
Using divination magic, you grant your ranged weapon the ability to seek out your target, allowing the projectile to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The projectile flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the projectile to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the projectile, plus extra force damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.
<h3>Shadow Shot</h3>
You weave illusion magic into a ranged weapon attack, causing it to occlude your foe's vision with shadows. The creature hit by the attack takes extra psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Exploit Die, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.
