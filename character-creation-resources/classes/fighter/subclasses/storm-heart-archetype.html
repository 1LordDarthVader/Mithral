        <h1>Storm Heart Archetype</h1>
        These fighters are a form of magic user called a half-spark. They are people who are talented in one specific area of magic: and their talent is in lightning. They benefit from a magical phenomenon that causes their body to be able to store a massive electric charge, and release it as easily as they would a breath of air. This makes them very dangerous fighters, and even lovers; because if they are not disciplined enough all it takes in small flare of emotion and the person standing closest to them may be struck by lightning.
<h2>Storm Surge</h2>
At 3rd, when you choose this archetype, your talent with lightning manifests. It gives you the ability to accelerate and enhance your body beyond what is normally possible using the energy you can create. As a bonus action, you can use this feature to gain one of the following benefits until the start of your next turn:
<ul>
<li>Your walking speed increases by 15 feet</li>
<li>You gain advantage on Dexterity ability checks and saving throws</li>
<li>Your movement does not provoke opportunity attacks</li>
</ul>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Perfect Grounding</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you look forward to getting hit by lighting. You gain resistance to lighting damage.<br><br>
Additionally, if you are forced make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid lightning damage from a spell or ability such as lightning bolt, you can use your reaction to consume the erupting electricity and cause the spell or ability to deal half damage to you, and any other creature who had to make the save. You regain one use of your Storm Surge feature if you take 15 or more lightning damage after using this feature.
<h2>Arcing Strikes</h2>
By 10th level, you have learned how to release your energy in a very precise manner, arcing it from one point to another. The first time you hit a creature on your turn after using your storm surge ability, you may deal lightning damage to another creature within 20 feet of the target equal to half of any bludgeoning, piercing, slashing and/or lightning damage you dealt with the attack.<br><br>
At 18th level you may target two creatures with this feature instead of one.
<h2>Ride the Lightning</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you can use the power in your body in order to lift you off the ground. As an action, you can expend a use of your Storm Surge feature in order to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 10 minutes. You can hover when flying this way.
<h2>Stormborn</h2>
At 18th level, you can use an action to the Chain Lightning spell without expending a spell slot. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.<br><br>
Once you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Storm Heart Exploits</h2>
<h3>Half-spark's Knowledge</h3>
Whenever you make an Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Nature) check, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know whether you succeed or fail.
<h3>Lightning Lance</h3>
When you throw a melee weapon as part of an attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to convert the weapon to pure electricity. On a hit, the weapon deals lightning damage instead of its normal damage type and deals additional damage equal to your Exploit Die + your Charisma modifier.<br><br>
When used in this way, the weapon breaks.
<h3>Lightning Strike</h3>
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to deal additional lightning damage to the target, equal to your Exploit Die + your Charisma modifier.
