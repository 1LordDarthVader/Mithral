        <h1>Flame Heart Archetype</h1>
        The flame heart is one of the elemental cousins of the storm heart. They are both known as half-sparks, individuals extremely talented in one aspect of magic. As their name suggests, a flame hearts talent is fire.<br><br>
Like the Storm heart, their talents mainly emerge from a magical phenomenon. The flame heart's body can absorb massive amounts of heat, and generate just as much on its own. This often caused by emotional duress, or stressful situation in their early years, but as they gain experience they learn to control it, using it as both a tool and a weapon to rival the pyromancer's claim of mastery over the fire.
