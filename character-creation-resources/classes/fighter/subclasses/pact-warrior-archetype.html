        <h1>Pact Warrior Archetype</h1>
        Those who walk the dark path of the Pact Warrior are driven by an overwhelming desire to destroy the great evils of the world. Those especially dedicated, those willing to give up anything, are often approached by Eldritch Powers, beings of otherworldly might. These benefactors offer power in return for a fraction of the warrior's soul or unquestioning fealty.

<h2>Pact Magic</h2>
At 3rd level, the bargain you have struck with your Patron allows you to cast spells, much like a warlock does.
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
        You learn one cantrip of your choice from the <a href="../../../spells/classes/warlock.html">warlock spell list</a>. Upon reaching 10th level in this class you learn one additional warlock cantrip of your choice.
<h3>Spell Slots</h3>
The Pact Warrior Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of those spell slots. All of your spell slots from this feature are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.
<h3>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</h3>
You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Pact Warrior Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warlock spells of 1st-level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.<br><br>
When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells.<br><br>
<strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier<br />
<strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier
<h2>Sanguine Offering</h2>
You have learned to sacrifice your own vitality to your Patron for increased martial potency. Starting at 3rd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one of your fighter Hit Die as part of the attack to deal an additional 2d10 necrotic damage to the target, in addition to the normal damage of your weapon.
<h2>Eldritch Power</h2>
When you adopt this Archetype at 3rd level, you gain minor eldritch abilities that reflect the source of your power.<br><br>
You gain one proficiency of your choice, and you learn one cantrip of your choice from any class spell list. This cantrip doesn't count against your total number of Cantrips Known.
<h2>Otherworldly Step</h2>
Beginning at 7th level, you can draw upon the dark power gifted to you by your Patron to slip through cracks in reality. As an action, you can expend an Exploit Die to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. If you appear within 5 feet of a creature, you can make one melee weapon attack against them as part of the same action.
<h2>Enchanted Strikes</h2>
The eldritch magic within your blood seeps into your weapon strikes, undercutting resistance to spells. Starting at 10th level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.
<h2>Improved Sanguine Offering</h2>
You can restore your own vitality by inflicting pain on others. Beginning at 15th level, when you empower a weapon attack with your Sanguine Offering, you gain temporary hit points equal to the additional necrotic damage dealt to the creature.<br><br>
Temporary hit points from this ability last for one minute, or until you gain temporary hit points from a different source.
<h2>Profane Sacrifice</h2>
Upon reaching 18th level, you can offer the death of your foes to your Eldritch Power in return for enhanced abilities. As a reaction when a creature dies within 30 feet of you, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice:
<ul>
<li>You have advantage on any weapon attack you make before the end of your next turn.</li>
<li>You regain 1d4 +1 expended Hit Dice.</li>
<li>You regain one expended Pact Magic spell slot.</li>
</ul>
You can use this ability a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Pact Warrior Exploits</h2>
<h3>Cursed Blade</h3>
As a bonus action, you can expend an Exploit Die to enhance a weapon you touch. For 1 minute, attacks with that weapon count as magical for the sake of overcoming resistances and immunities to attacks with non-magical weapons.
<h3>Eldritch Insight</h3>
When you make an Intelligence (Arcana) or a check using the proficiency gained from your Eldritch Power, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know if you succeed or fail.
<h3>Spellguard</h3>
As a reaction when you make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw to resist a spell, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know if you succeed or fail.
