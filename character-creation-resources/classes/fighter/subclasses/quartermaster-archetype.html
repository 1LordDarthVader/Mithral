        <h1>Quartermaster Archetype</h1>
        Every successful adventurer knows the value of teamwork, but none value it more then those known as Quartermasters. These supportive warriors strive to help their allies reach their full potential. Constantly putting the needs of their companions before their own, Quartermasters keep their team in top condition with a fresh Ration and a helping hand.
<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
At 3rd level you gain proficiency with cook's utensils, land vehicles, and in the Animal Handling skill. If you are already proficient with any of these skills, you can add double your proficiency bonus to any check that uses that tool or skill.
<h2>Rations</h2>
Beginning at 3rd level, you can prepare Rations, morsels of potent food that keep your allies in peak condition. At the end of each long rest, you can prepare a number of Rations equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 Ration).<br><br>
As an action, you can expend an Exploit Die to prepare additional Rations. You can eat a Ration, or feed the Ration to a creature within 5 feet as part of the same action used to create it. Prepared Rations can be eaten or fed to another creature as a bonus action. Any Rations you create become inert at the end of your next short or long rest. Consuming a Ration ends any current Ration effects on that creature.
<h2>Dependable</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to take the Help action, targeting a creature within 10 feet.
<h2>Improved Rations</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can use a bonus action to spend an Exploit Die to create a Ration, and any Ration with a duration of 1 minute has its duration increased to 1 hour.
<h2>Ever Ready</h2>
You are always ready to support your companions. Beginning at 15th level, when you roll initiative, you prepare a single Ration of your choice without expending an Exploit Die.
<h2>Iron Stomach</h2>
Your work taste testing experimenting with new wondrous Ration formulas has toughened your body and hardened your stomach. Upon reaching 18th level your Constitution score, and maximum Constitution score, both increase by 2, and you are immune to the poisoned condition.<br><br>
In addition, you are always under the effects of one Ration of your choice with a duration of at least 1 minute. It does not need to be a Ration that you prepared, and you can change the Ration effect at the end of each short or long rest.
<h2>Rations</h2>
Below are the Rations available to Quartermaster fighters. If a Ration has a level prerequisite, it refers to your fighter level, and you must meet the prerequisite to prepare it. A creature gains the Ration's benefits immediately upon consuming it.
<h3>Fortifying Ration (3rd level)</h3>
Choose either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. For 1 minute, the creature can add your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1) to any ability check or saving throw for the chosen ability score.
<h3>Invigorating Ration (3rd level)</h3>
The creature regains hit points equal to your Constitution modifier + your Exploit Die.
<h3>Revitalizing Ration (3rd level)</h3>
The creature ends one of the following conditions currently effecting it: blindness, deafness, poison, or they reduce their exhaustion level by 1.
<h3>Heightening Ration (7th level)</h3>
Choose either Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom. For 1 minute, the creature can add your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1) to any ability check or saving throw for the chosen ability score.
<h3>Tenacious Ration (7th level)</h3>
Choose blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, poisoned, paralyzed, or stunned. For 1 minute, the creature gains immunity to that condition.
<h3>Warding Ration (7th level)</h3>
You gain resistance to one of the following damage types for 1 minute: acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, piercing, poison, lighting, slashing, or thunder.
<h3>Berserker Ration (15th level)</h3>
For 1 hour, you do not fall unconscious when reduced to 0 hit points. You still make death saving throws as normal, and die upon three failures. A creature that consumes this Ration cannot gain the benefits of another Ration until they finish a long rest.
<h3>Rejuvenating Ration (15th level)</h3>
You instantly gain all the benefits of a short rest, including the ability to spend Hit Dice, as part of consuming this Ration. In addition to the short rest, you immediately gain 1 level of exhaustion. A creature that consumes this Ration cannot gain the benefits of another Ration until they finish a long rest.
