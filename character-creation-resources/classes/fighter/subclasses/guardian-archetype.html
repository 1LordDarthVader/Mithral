        <h1>Guardian Archetype</h1>
        Guardians are elite defensive warriors whose strengths shine while fighting side by side with their allies. Though trained to use weapons of all types, Guardians are especially effective when using a protective style of fighting with a weapon and shield. Alone, a Guardian is a small threat, but when fighting alongside their allies they are impenetrable walls of steel.
<h2>Guardian Stance</h2>
Beginning at 3rd level, so long as you are wielding a shield, you can expend an Exploit Die as a bonus action to enter a Guardian Stance. It lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if you are incapacitated, you doff your shield, or you end it as a free action. While in this Stance, you gain the following features:
<ul>
<li>Your movement speed is reduced by 10 feet.</li>
<li>Creatures of your choice within 5 feet that are wielding a shield gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class.</li>
<li>As a reaction, when a creature within 5 feet is hit by an attack, you can become the target of the attack, taking the damage of the attack if it would hit you.</li>
<li>As a bonus action, you can make a special melee attack with your shield. On hit, your shield deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Warrior Smith</h2>
You gain the skills to maintain your arms and armor so that you may better defend your allies. At 3rd level you gain proficiency with leatherworker's tools and smith's tools.<br><br>
If you are already proficient with these tools you gain proficiency with another set of artisan's tools of your choice.
<h2>Rallying Wind</h2>
You can rally your allies to hold the line. Starting at 7th level, when you use Second Wind, creatures of your choice within<br />
5 feet gain temporary hit points equal to your fighter level.
<h2>Stalwart Defender</h2>
Your defensive tactics grow stronger when amongst your allies. Starting at 10th level, while you are in your Guardian Stance, you gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class for each friendly creature within 5 feet of you that is wielding a shield.<br><br>
In addition, so long as your are not surprised when you roll initiative, you can choose to enter your Guardian Stance as a reaction without expending an Exploit Die.
<h2>Improved Guardian Stance</h2>
Starting at 15th level, while you are in your Guardian Stance, creatures of your choice within 5 feet of you gain the benefits of half cover, even if they are not wielding a shield.
<h2>Legendary Guardian</h2>
You have become a master Guardian. Starting at 18th level, any benefits from your Guardian Stance and Guardian Archetype Exploits affect creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you, even if they are not wielding a shield.
<h2>Guardian Exploits</h2>
<h3>Guardian's Resilience</h3>
When you are forced to make a Strength saving throw, a saving throw to resist the effects of exhaustion, or a smith's tools check, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know whether you succeed or fail.
<h3>Heart of Steel</h3>
As a reaction when you are hit by a melee attack, you can expend an Exploit Die and reduce the damage by an amount equal to twice your Exploit Die + your Constitution modifier.
<h3>Immovable</h3>
As an action, you can expend an Exploit Die and plant your feet in an immovable stance. Until the end of your next turn, a creature that would move you, or move through your space, must succeed on a Strength saving throw in order to do so.
