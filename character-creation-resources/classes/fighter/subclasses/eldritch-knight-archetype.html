        <h1>Eldritch Knight Archetype</h1>
        The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.

<h2>Spellcasting</h2>
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
        You learn two cantrips of your choice from the <a href="../../../spells/classes/arcane.html">arcane spell list</a>. You learn an additional arcane cantrip of your choice at 10th level.
<h3>Spell Slots</h3>
The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your arcane spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
<h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
You know three 1st-level arcane spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the arcane spell list.<br><br>
The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more arcane spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br><br>
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the arcane spells you know with another spell of your choice from the arcane spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
Intelligence or Wisdom (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization.<br><br>
<strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier<br />
<strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier
<h2>War Magic</h2>
You weave minor spells between your weapon attacks. Starting at 7th level, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can cast a cantrip in place of one of your attacks.
<h2>Enchanted Strikes</h2>
Your weapon attacks weaken a creature's resistance to your magic. Starting at 10th level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell cast by you, before the end of your next turn.
<h2>Arcane Surge</h2>
Starting at 15th level, when you use your Action Surge, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can teleport before or after the additional action.
<h2>Legendary Eldritch Knight</h2>
You are a master of spell and sword. Starting at 18th level, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can cast an Arcane Knight spell in place of one of your weapon attacks.
<h2>Eldritch Knight Exploits</h2>
<h3>Arcanist's Insight</h3>
Whenever you make an Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (History), or Intelligence (Religion) check, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know if you succeed or fail.
<h3>Arcane Smite</h3>
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to deal additional force damage to the target, equal to your Exploit Die + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice).
<h3>Spellguard</h3>
As a reaction when you make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw to resist a spell, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know if you succeed or fail.
