        <h1>Guerilla Archetype</h1>
        No matter the mission, a Guerrilla will execute it with utmost perfection. Sometimes known as commandos, these warriors are marked by their determination and adaptability. Whether harsh terrain, vicious monsters, enemy soldiers, or powerful spellcasters, nothing short of death will cause the willpower of a Guerrilla warrior to waver in the pursuit of their goals.
<h2>Adaptable Combatant</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can adjust your skills to meet the challenge at hand. At the end of a long rest, you can replace one Exploit you know with another Exploit of your choice.<br><br>
In addition, you learn an Exploit of your choice from your list of Guerrilla Exploits. This additional Exploit doesn't count against your total number of Exploits Known.
<h2>Survivalist</h2>
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Athletics, Perception, Stealth, or Survival.<br><br>
Starting when you reach 7th level in this class, you can add double your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make that uses either proficiency you gained through this feature.
<h2>By Land or Sea</h2>
You have trained to succeed in any environment, no matter the obstacles. At 7th level, you gain one of the features below. You gain the other feature from this list at 10th level.
<ul>
<li><strong>Alpine Combatant.</strong> You steel yourself for battle at great heights. You gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed, and as a reaction, you can reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to your fighter level.</li>
<li><strong>Marine Combatant.</strong> You have prepared for amphibious combat. You gain a swimming speed equal to your movement speed, and you can hold your breath for up to 1 hour.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adaptable Fighting Style</h2>
You can change your style of fighting to better counter your foes. Starting at 10th level, when you finish a long rest, you can replace your Fighting Style with another Fighting Style of your choice from the list in the fighter class description.
<h2>Unwavering</h2>
You are remarkably resilient. Beginning at 15th level, when you use Second Wind you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>You regain one of your expended Exploit Dice.</li>
<li>Your level of exhaustion, if any, is reduced by 1.</li>
<li>You can add double your proficiency bonus to the first Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability check or saving throw you make within the next minute.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Legendary Guerrilla</h2>
Starting at 18th level, there is nothing that can stand between you and your goals should you have time to prepare. You can use your Adaptable Combatant and Adaptable Fighting Style features at the end of each short or long rest.
<h2>Guerrilla Exploits</h2>
<h3>Adapt</h3>
When you make a saving throw to resist the effects of a hostile environment, or you make Strength (Athletics) or a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know if you succeed or fail.
<h3>Improvise</h3>
When you make an ability check that does not include your proficiency bonus, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You must use this Exploit before you roll.
<h3>Overcome</h3>
When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to expend an Exploit Die and make a Constitution saving throw. The save DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. On a successful save, you drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.
