        <h1>Frost Heart Archetype</h1>
        The frost heart is one of the elemental cousins of the storm heart. They are both known as half-sparks, individuals extremely talented in one aspect of magic. Frost hearts are masters of the ice and snow.<br><br>
The magical phenomenon that gives the frost heart its abilities is that they can cause the air around them to reach temperatures well below freezing without any effect to them at all. They can protect themselves with thick layers of ice that doesn't bother them, making them hard to kill in a frontal engagement.
<h2>Frost Surge</h2>
At 3rd level, when you choose this subclass, you can use your magical abilities to freeze the air around you and form a layer of ice on your person to give yourself extra protection.<br><br>
As a bonus action, you can give yourself temporary hit points equal to twice your Fighter level. Additionally, for the next minute, once per turn you can cause a creature you hit with a melee weapon attack to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature suffers one of the following effects of your choice until the start of your next turn:
<ul>
<li>The creature's speed is reduced by 15 feet.</li>
<li>The creature can't take reactions.</li>
<li>The creature can take either an action or bonus action on their turn, not both.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Glacial Constitution</h2>
Starting at 7th level, your cold-loving nature gives you resistance to cold damage and acclimates you to extreme heat and extreme cold.<br><br>
Additionally, you can use an action to touch and freeze a 10 ft by 10 ft area of water or other freezable liquid to a depth of 1 foot.
<h2>Biting Cold</h2>
Starting at 10th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal cold damage to the attacker equal to your Fighter level.<br><br>
Additionally, if you are forced make a Constitution saving throw to avoid cold damage from a spell or ability such as cone of cold, you can use your reaction to consume the erupting ice and cause the spell or ability to deal half damage to you, and any other creature who had to make the save. You regain one use of your Frost Surge feature if you take 15 or more cold damage after using this feature.
<h2>Glacial Armor</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as immunity to cold damage, while you have the temporary hit points from your Frost Surge feature.
<h2>Lord of the Frosts</h2>
Starting at 18th level, you can expend a use of your Action Surge to cast the Cone of Cold spell. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.<br><br>
Once you do this you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Frost Heart Exploits</h2>
<h3>Half-spark's Knowledge</h3>
Whenever you make an Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Nature) check, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know whether you succeed or fail.
<h3>Glacial Defense</h3>
If you do not have any temporary hit points when you roll initiative, you can expend an Exploit Die to gain an amount equal to 5 times a roll of your Exploit Die.
<h3>Icy Strike</h3>
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to deal additional cold damage to the target, equal to your Exploit Die + your Charisma modifier.
