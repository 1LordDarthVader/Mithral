        <h1>Juggernaut Archetype</h1>
        Juggernauts are simple warriors who rely on their own durability to overcome their enemies. Some juggernauts combine this physical might with tactical cunning. Others just hit things until those things stop hitting back.
<h2>Brutish Weapons</h2>
At 3rd level, any melee weapon you wield gains the Reach property if it does not already have it. Additionally, you can ignore the Heavy property of weapons.
<h2>Push Forward</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you are able to push yourself on pure adrenaline when you are badly injured. If your current hit points are less than half of your maximum hit points, your base movement speed increases by 5 feet and, once per turn, when you roll damage for a weapon attack, you can add your proficiency bonus to the roll.
<h2>Unyielding Mind</h2>
By the time you reach 7th level, your mind is as hardened as your body. Your thoughts cannot be read by any means, including magic or telepathy, unless you allow it.
<h2>Shrug It Off</h2>
At 10th level, you can function through conditions that cripple lesser beings. You ignore the effect of exhaustion up to level 5, suffering no ill effects until that point.
<h2>Death Dealer</h2>
By 15th level, you can deal devastating blows to your enemies while they are most vulnerable. When you use your Action Surge, you can choose to use this feature and gain two additional actions instead of one. Once you have used this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
<h2>Hero of Legend</h2>
When you reach 18th level, you have become a true legend like the heroes told of in stories. Chose any one ability score. You gain a +2 to that ability score and your maximum for that score is now 22.
<h2>Juggernaut Exploits</h2>
<h3>Juggernaut's Expertise</h3>
Whenever you make a Strength (Athletics) check or saving throw against being frightened or charmed, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know whether you succeed or fail.
<h3>Thunderous Blow</h3>
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die and force it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, they takes additional thunder damage equal to your Exploit Die and is pushed away from you 10 feet in a straight line. Creatures more than one size larger than you have advantage on their saving throw.<br><br>
For each additional Exploit Die you expend as part of the attack, the creature is knocked back an additional 10 feet.
<h3>Unbreaking</h3>
As a reaction when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend an Exploit Die to drop to 1 hit point instead.
