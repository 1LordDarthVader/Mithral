        <h1>Templar Archetype</h1>
        An archetypical Knight Templar bears a distinct resemblance to paladins and clerics, particularly in the way they present themselves. While they lack the divine magic offered by these classes, their divine fervor and unshakeable devotion to their gods are far from lacking.<br><br>
A Templar fights for their deity, commonly acting as crusaders or, less commonly, inquisitors of the faith. These fighters come from all walks of life, united by their zealotry and unbreakable faith. In their training, they become capable combatants, devoted friends, and learned scholars of their faith. A Templar's way of life is arduous—they are always fighting for something, whether for their god, their companions, or a moral cause.
<h2>Bonus Proficiency</h2>
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Religion skill. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in another skill of your choice.
<h2>Zealot's Devotion</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you can devote yourself to a cause.<br><br>
As a bonus action, you can devote yourself towards either defender of kin or slayer of foes. Both choices use your zealotry die as part of their effects, and your choice lasts until you choose a different one or are incapacitated.
<ul>
<li><strong>Defender of Kin.</strong> You devote yourself towards defending your allies. While this feature lasts, you can use your bonus action to rally a creature other than you that is within 10 feet of you. The targeted creature gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). These temporary hit points last until the start of your next turn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slayer of Foes.</strong> You devote yourself towards slaying your enemies. If you hit a creature with an attack while this feature lasts, you can use your bonus action to empower that attack. The target takes additional radiant damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scholar of Evil and Good</h2>
By 7th level, you have learned much about the creatures of evil and good—aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead—granting you advantage on any Charisma checks you make while interacting with them, and allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to any Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw imposed by one of these creatures if you don't add your proficiency to that save already.
<h2>Surge of Faith</h2>
Starting at 10th level, using your Action Surge feature also allows you to take an additional bonus action on your turn, and increases your speed by 15 feet until the end of turn.
<h2>Endless Fervor</h2>
Beginning at 15th level, your Zealot's Devotion feature is improved. You gain a +1 bonus to your AC while Defender of Kin is active, and a +1 bonus to your weapon attack rolls while Slayer of Foes is active.
<h2>Deus Ex Machina</h2>
By 18th level, the gods have noticed your ceaseless devotion, and have taken interest in your fate. You have advantage on death saving throws. You may cast the Augury spell at will, without requiring any material components.
<h2>Templar Exploits</h2>
<h3>Battle Medic</h3>
You can expend an Exploit Die to attempt to stabilize a creature as a bonus action, adding your Exploit Die to the Wisdom (Medicine) check.
<h3>Blazing Light</h3>
As a bonus action, you expend an Exploit Die to create a blinding flash of light. A creature of your choice within 30 feet must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the start of your next turn and take radiant damage equal to a roll of your Exploit Die.
<h3>Living Torch</h3>
As a bonus action, you expend an Exploit Die, causing you to radiate bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that for the next minute.
