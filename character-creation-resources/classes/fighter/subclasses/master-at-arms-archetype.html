        <h1>Master At Arms Archetype</h1>
        While most fighters master one specific martial technique or discipline, a Master at Arms is the rare warrior who is able to truly master multiple styles of combat. Whether through grit, extreme dedication, or extraordinary skill, these elite fighters learn all they can about the theories and armaments of war. They are always on the lookout for a new weapon to master, or a teacher from which to learn a new style of fighting.
<h2>Fluid Stances</h2>
Whether through innate talent or training, you have mastered multiple styles of combat. At 3rd level, you learn an additional Fighting Style of your choice. However, you can only gain the benefits of one of the Fighting Styles you know at a time.<br><br>
As a bonus action, you can change your current Fighting Style to another of your choice Fighting Style that you know.
<h2>Master of Forms</h2>
Your ability to master martial techniques exceeds even that of other fighters. Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you learn a new Exploit, you can choose to learn an Archetype exclusive Exploit, in addition to the Exploits available to all fighters.<br><br>
You also learn one additional Exploit of your choice, which doesn't count against your total number of Exploits Known.<br><br>
Also at 3rd level, your Exploit Dice all become d6s. As you gain levels in this class, your Exploit Dice increase in size again; at 5th level (d8), 9th level (d10), and 13th level (d12).
<h2>Consistent Skill</h2>
You are able to fight at your peak capability for longer than most other warriors. Starting at 7th level, when you use your Second Wind, you regain one of your expended Exploit Dice.
<h2>Advanced Technique</h2>
Your study of war has increased your knowledge of martial techniques. At 7th level, you learn another Fighting Style of your choice (for a total of three), though you can still only gain the benefits of one of your known Fighting Styles at a time.<br><br>
You also learn one additional Exploit of your choice, which doesn't count against your total number of Exploits Known.
<h2>Masterful Surge</h2>
You can draw on your techniques as a reflex in times of great need. Starting at 10th level, when you use your Action Surge, you gain one Exploit Die that must be used as part of the additional action granted to you by your Action Surge. If not used, it disappears at the end of your additional action.
<h2>Superior Technique</h2>
In your studies you have mastered an impressive amount of combat styles. At 15th level, you learn another Fighting Style of your choice (for a total of four), though you can still only gain the benefits of one of your Fighting Styles at a time.<br><br>
You also learn one additional Exploit of your choice, which doesn't count against your total number of Exploits Known.
<h2>Warrior of Legend</h2>
Upon reaching 18th level, your mastery over the armaments of war has become nearly supernatural. Once per turn, when you use an Exploit you know, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending one of your Exploit Dice.<br><br>
Also, at the end of each long rest, you can choose either one Exploit or one Fighting Style you know, and replace it with another Exploit or Fighting Style of your choice.
