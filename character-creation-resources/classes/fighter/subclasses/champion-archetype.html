        <h1>Champion Archetype</h1>
        While most fighters improve their capabilities by mastering various combat techniques, or augment their skill with magic, Champions forgo all other routes to improvement and focus on enhancing their raw physical strength. Imposing figures; Champions strive to maintain their peak physical condition through never-ending training. On the battlefield, Champions perform feats of supernatural athleticism and overwhelm their foes with their immense physical might.
<h2>Mighty Warrior</h2>
When you adopt this Archetype at 3rd level, the raw physical might that you have cultivated enhances your attacks. Your weapon attacks now score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.<br><br>
You also learn the Feat of Strength Exploit, but it doesn't count against your number of Exploits Known. If you already know this Exploit, you learn another Exploit of your choice.
<h2>Remarkable Athlete</h2>
Your intense training and dedication to physical perfection allows you to perform feats of athleticism that would seem impossible for most mortals. Starting at 7th level, you can add your proficiency bonus to any Strength or Constitution check you make. If you would already add your proficiency bonus to that check you add double your proficiency bonus.<br><br>
Also, when you make a standing or running high or long jump, the distance you can jump increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of 1 foot).
<h2>Additional Fighting Style</h2>
Your raw skill surpasses that of most other fighters. At 10th level, you learn an additional Fighting Style of your choice. You cannot select a Fighting Style that you already know.
<h2>Paragon of Might</h2>
The power of your attacks overwhelms any foe who would dare stand against you. Beginning at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18 through 20.<br><br>
Also, whenever you make a Strength check or Strength saving throw, you roll a d6 and add the result to your roll, in addition to any other bonuses to that check or saving throw.
<h2>Legendary Champion</h2>
You are a nearly perfect specimen of physical vigor, and have become exceedingly hard to kill. Starting at 18th level, if you start your turn with half of your hit points or less remaining, you immediately regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 5 hit points).<br><br>
You do not regain any hit points from this feature if you begin your turn with 0 hit points.
<h2>Champion Exploits</h2>
<h3>Champion's Vigor</h3>
Whenever you make a saving throw to resist the effects of exhaustion, or you make Strength (Athletics) or a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know if you succeed or fail.
<h3>Concussive Blow</h3>
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to force them to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes additional damage equal to your Exploit Die and is stunned until the beginning of your next turn.
<h3>Crippling Strike</h3>
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die and force it to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes additional damage equal to your Exploit Die and its movement speed is reduced to 0 until the beginning of your next turn.
