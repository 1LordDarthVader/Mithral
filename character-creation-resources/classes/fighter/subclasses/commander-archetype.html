        <h1>Commander Archetype</h1>
        Not all fighters rely solely on themselves in battle, some use their deep knowledge of battlefield tactics to coordinate their allies. Commanders are warriors who lead from the front of the battle, issuing orders and inspiring greatness in others by their own brave deeds. By their presence, a Commander can transform an unorganized militia into a deadly fighting force.
<h2>Art of War</h2>
In your training you have gained the skill to navigate high society. At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in your choice of either History, Insight, Investigation, or Persuasion.<br><br>
You also learn the Attack Command Exploit, but it doesn't count against your total number of Exploits Known.
<h2>Rallying Cry</h2>
Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you expend an Exploit Die to use Attack Command, the target gains temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.<br><br>
Also, whenever you use Second Wind, you can choose up to three creatures within 30 feet that can see or hear you. Targets immediately regain hit points equal to your Exploit Die + your Charisma modifier. Hit points a creature would gain over their maximum become temporary hit points.
<h2>Strategic Command</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you can organize and command your allies even as you fight. Once per turn, you can use the Attack Command Exploit without expending an Exploit Die.
<h2>Heroic Surge</h2>
Your heroic action inspires your allies. Starting at 10th level, when you use Action Surge, you can choose one creature within 30 feet that can see or hear you. That creature can then use their reaction to move up to their movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks. At the end of this movement, they can make one weapon attack.
<h2>Inspiring Commands</h2>
Beginning at 15th level, when you expend an Exploit Die to use a Martial Exploit that targets a friendly creature, the target creature has advantage on the first attack roll, ability check, or saving throw they make within the next minute.
<h2>Legendary Commander</h2>
Your ability to inspire others and lead allies into battle rivals the great conquerors and commanders of legend. Starting at 18th level, your Heroic Surge can affect two creatures of your choice within 30 feet that can see or hear you.
<h2>Commander Exploits</h2>
<h3>Attack Command</h3>
When you take the Attack action, you can expend an Exploit Die in place of one of your attacks to issue a command to a creature within 30 feet that can see or hear you. The target creature can use their reaction to make one weapon attack, adding your Exploit Die to the damage roll of the attack.
<h3>Commander's Insight</h3>
When you make an Intelligence (History), Wisdom (Insight), or Intelligence (Investigation) check, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know if you succeed or fail.
<h3>Maneuvering Command</h3>
When you take the Attack action, you can expend an Exploit Die in place of one of your attacks to issue a command to a creature within 30 feet that can see or hear you. The target creature can then use their reaction to move up to its full movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
