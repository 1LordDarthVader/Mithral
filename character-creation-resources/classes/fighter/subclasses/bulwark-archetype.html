        <h1>Bulwark Archetype</h1>
        Some fighters think of shields only as a defensive object, protecting them from blows and getting in the way of their enemies' attacks. Bulwarks are knights who use their shields as deadly weapons. A shield is as deadly in the hands of a Bulwark as a greatsword. Bulwarks are renowned for their toughness and endurance, and are notoriously difficult to kill.
<h2>Toughness</h2>
Beginning when you choose this subclass at 3rd level, you are tougher than most other fighters. You gain three additional hit points at 3rd level and an additional hit point for every Fighter level beyond 3rd.<br><br>
In addition, you may reroll the die used for your Second Wind feature, and must use the new roll.
<h2>Remarkable Endurance</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you are renowned for your endurance. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid exhaustion or disease, as well as the paralyzed, petrified, restrained, or stunned conditions.
<h2>Guardian</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you are particularly adept at protecting your allies. You gain the benefits of the Protection fighting style if you don't already have it, and gain the benefits of the Defense fighting style if you do.<br><br>
In addition, the Protection fighting style gains the ability to impose disadvantage on checks made to grapple or shove, and advantage on Strength or Dexterity saving throws.
<h2>Improved Toughness</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you are even tougher than you were before. You gain fifteen additional hit points at 15th level and an additional hit point for every Fighter level beyond 15th.
<h2>Last Stand</h2>
Starting at 18th level, when you fall you can unleash one last burst of energy. When you are reduced to zero hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to immediately take one extra turn, interrupting the current turn, during which none of the actions you take can heal you in any way. On this extra turn, you have advantage on all melee attack rolls and deal a extra damage equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) with your melee attacks. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious as normal.<br><br>
You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Bulwark Exploits</h2>
<h3>Interpose</h3>
As a reaction when a creature you can see within 30 feet is attacked, you can expend an Exploit Die and move up to your speed towards them. If you end your move within 5 feet of the target, you become the new target of the attack.
<h3>Shield Shove</h3>
As a bonus action after making a melee attack on your turn, you can expend an Exploit Die to attempt to shove a target with your shield. The target must succeed a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you or knocked prone (your choice).
<h3>Shield Wall</h3>
As a reaction when targeted by an effect that affects an area, you expend an Exploit Die to brace yourself with your shield. You and creatures behind you up to a range of triple your height gain half cover against the effect.
