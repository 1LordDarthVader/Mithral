        <h1>Tinker Knight Archetype</h1>
        The fighters known as Tinker Knights seek an unorthodox form of martial skill. Rather than master martial techniques they look to augment their physical ability with mechanical inventions and innovative weaponry. Though they spend most of their time theorizing, tinkering, and experimenting with new Schematics, Tinker Knights and their inventive arsenals are a force to be reckoned with on the field of battle.
<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
When you adopt this Archetype at 3rd level, you gain the skill to maintain your inventions. You gain proficiency with tinker's and smith's tools. If you already proficient with these tools, you gain proficiency with another set of tools of your choice.
<h2>Inventive Arsenal</h2>
You have come up with a cacophony of strange modifications for weapons and armor, known as Schematics. At 3rd level, you learn two Schematics of your choice from the list at the end of this Archetype. When you gain a level, you can replace one Schematic you know with another of your choice.<br><br>
As you gain levels in this class, your number of Schematics known grows; at 7th level (3), 10th level (4), and 15th level (5).<br><br>
At the end of each a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to your number of Schematics Known and you modify each object with the features of one Schematic. These features last until the end of your next long rest. An object can only be modified by one Schematic at a time, and it must meet the requirements in the Schematic's description.
<h3>Saving Throws</h3>
If a Schematic requires a saving throw, your Schematic save DC is calculated as follows:
<strong>Schematic save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
<h2>Tinker's Expertise</h2>
Your skills rival the best of innovators. Starting at 7th level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with tinker's or smith's tools.<br><br>
In addition, items modified by your Schematics count as magical for overcoming resistances and immunities, and you can apply your Schematics to magic weapons and armor.
<h2>Mechanical Synergy</h2>
Your modifications work in tandem. Beginning at 10th level, you can apply two Schematics to one object, so long as the object meets the prerequisites for both Schematics.
<h2>Flexible Innovation</h2>
Your inventive arsenal can adjust to meet the challenges at hand. Starting at 15th level, at the end of a short rest, you can transfer a Schematic from one object to another, so long as the new object meets the prerequisites. If a Schematic has a limited amount of charges, the number of expended charges remains the same when transferred.<br><br>
In addition, you can apply up to three Schematics to one object, so long as it meets all the Schematic prerequisites.
<h2>Masterwork Inventions</h2>
Your innovations are wondrous in their effects. Beginning at 18th level, a weapon modified by a Schematic gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls for each Schematic applied to it, and a set of armor modified by a Schematic gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class for each Schematic applied to it.<br><br>
Weapons and armor modified by your Schematics cannot gain a bonus greater then +3, regardless of any bonuses the item may have had before applying your Schematics.
