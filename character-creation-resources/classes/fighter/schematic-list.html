<h1>Schematics</h1>

<h2 id="toc0"><span>Featherweight Schematic</span></h2>
<p>You modify the metallurgical makeup of an item, making it lighter. The wearer or wielder of an object modified by this Schematic has their movement speed increased by 10 feet.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heavy Armor.</strong> When applied, the wearer ignores any Strength requirements the armor may have, or any penalty it may impose upon their Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</li>
<li><strong>Light Armor.</strong> When applied, the wearer can subtract up to 100 feet from their fall distance when calculating fall damage and can move horizontally 2 feet for every 1 foot they fall.</li>
<li><strong>Weapon.</strong> When applied, a Heavy weapon becomes normal weight, and a normal weapon becomes a Light weapon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc1"><span>Intuitive Schematic</span></h2>
<p>You modify an item to take advantage of your martial and investigative instincts. The wearer or wielder of an object modified by this Schematic gains proficiency in Investigation and they can add double their proficiency bonus to any Intelligence (Investigation) checks they make.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Armor.</strong> When applied, the wearer can use their Intelligence in place of Dexterity, when calculating their Armor Class.</li>
<li><strong>Weapon.</strong> When applied, the wielder can use their Intelligence modifier, in place of Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls with this weapon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc2"><span>Radiant Schematic</span></h2>
<p>You imbue an item with a source of radiant energy. The wearer or wielder of an object modified by this Schematic can use a bonus action to cause the object to emit bright light in a 15-foot radius, and dim light 15 feet beyond that. They can extinguish the light as a bonus action on their turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Armor or Weapon.</strong> As a reaction wen you are hit by an attack (armor), or hit a creature with an attack (weapon), you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is blinded for 1 minute. It can repeat the save at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success. Once you use this reaction, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc3"><span>Rebounding Schematic</span></h2>
<p>You modify an item so that it has elastic properties. The wearer or wielder of an object modified by this Schematic can use their reaction to add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to their Armor Class against one attack.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Armor.</strong> As a reaction when the wearer of this armor is hit by an attack, they can reduce the damage by an amount equal to 1d12 + your Intelligence modifier. If the damage is reduced to 0, the attacker takes the full damage of the attack as if they had been the original target. Once you use this feature you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Heavy Weapon.</strong> When applied, the weapon gains the Thrown property with a range of 20 feet. After making an attack with this weapon, it immediately returns to the wielder.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc4"><span>Empowered Schematic</span></h2>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 7th level Tinker Knight</em><br>
You modify an object with clockwork mechanics that improve physical ability and sharpens reflexes. The wearer or wielder of an object modified by this Schematic gains a bonus to their initiative equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heavy Armor.</strong> When applied, the wearer can use your Intelligence score, in place of Strength, for any Strength ability checks or saving throws they make.</li>
<li><strong>Light Armor.</strong> When applied, the wearer can use your Intelligence score, in place of Dexterity, for any Dexterity ability checks or saving throws they make.</li>
<li><strong>Weapon.</strong> When applied, anytime the wielder rolls a 1 or 2 for a damage roll with this weapon, they can choose to re-roll the die, but you must use the new result even if it is a 1 or 2.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="toc5"><span>Resilient Schematic</span></h2>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 7th level Tinker Knight</em><br>
You modify the metallurgical makeup of this item to make it far more resilient. The wearer or wielder of an object modified by this Schematic has advantage on saving throws to resist being grappled or moved against their will.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Armor.</strong> When applied, this armor grants resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Weapon.</strong> When applied, this weapon deals bonus damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) + your fighter level when you score a critical hit.</li>
</ul>
