        <h1>Beauty Domain</h1>
        Beauty can both bend minds and inspire hearts. It is the force that compels others to lose control and give in to their impulses, but it can also awaken strength and determination to steel a forlorn heart. Aphrodite, Sune, Myhriss, Sheela Peryroyl, Eilistraee, Freya, Hanali Celanil and Branchala all include beauty, love and romance in their portfolios. These gods are patrons of bards, musicians, artists and all who dedicate themselves to instill beauty in the hearts of others.<br><br>
The Gods of Beauty and their clerics officiate weddings, arrange dates, and counsel those who have lost sight of what made them fall in love in the first place, all in the hopes that more people will be able to experience the wonder of true love and championing the pursuit of beauty itself.

<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. Additionally, you gain proficiency with the Disguise kit and two musical instruments of your choice.
<h2>Graceful</h2>
Beginning at 1st level, your inner and outer beauty makes you harder to hit. While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your spellcasting ability modifier.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Inner Beauty</h2>
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to change the physical appearance and self-image of a creature you see within 30 feet of you, revealing its true grace or exposing its ugliness for 10 minutes. Choose one of the following effects:
<ul>
<li>The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become insecure and have its body and visage slightly twisted and deformed, gaining disadvantage on Dexterity and Charisma ability checks for the duration.</li>
<li>The creature is filled with confidence and it becomes lovelier and more elegant, gaining advantage on Dexterity and Charisma ability checks for the duration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Channel Divinity: Blinding Beauty</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to take on a form so beautiful that mortal eyes cannot stand. As an action, you present your holy symbol. Choose a number of creatures up to your spellcasting ability modifier within 30 feet of you that can see you. Each creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn.
<h2>Potent Spellcasting</h2>
Starting at 8th level, you add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
<h2>Unearthly Beauty</h2>
Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to transform yourself into a vision of perfect beauty that mortal minds cannot comprehend for 1 minute or until you dismiss the effect. During that time, creatures that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. Creatures immune to being charmed are immune to these effects.<br><br>
Additionally, creatures failing their saving throw against your Channel Divinity options take 5d10 psychic damage and have their speed reduced to 0 until the end of their next turn.
