<h1>Luck Domain</h1>

Clerics that serve the fickle and spontaneous gods of Luck rarely resemble traditional clerics. Their holy symbols are usually sets of dice, pieces from gaming sets, or strange lucky charms. Luck clerics believe they earn favor with their god each time they leave their life in the hands of fate.

<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor, the Sleight of Hand skill, and with a gaming set of your choice.

<h2>Tip the Scales</h2>
From 1st level, you can protect yourself and others by tugging on the strings of luck. If you or an allied creature you can see within 30 feet is hit by an attack from an attacker you can see, you can use your reaction to add 1d4 to the creature's AC until the end of turn, potentially causing the attack to miss.

<br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

<h2>Channel Divinity: Lucky Break</h2>
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to inspire an ally with resolve and hope. As an action, you can present your holy symbol and select a creature you can see within 60 feet. Until the end of your next turn, the target makes all attack rolls and saving throws with advantage.

<h2>Lucky Streak</h2>
Starting at 6th level, when an attack roll is made against you and misses you, you can choose to gain temporary hit points equal to twice your cleric level. These temporary hit points last until the beginning of your next turn.

<br><br>Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

<h2>Divine Strike</h2>
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

<h2>Bend Reality</h2>
Starting at 17th level, when you or an ally you can see within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw, you can replace the roll with a 20, potentially changing the outcome. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
