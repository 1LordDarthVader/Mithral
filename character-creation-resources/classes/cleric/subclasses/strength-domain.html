        <h1>Strength Domain</h1>
        Gods of strength grant their faithful power and athletic ability, but realize one crucial detail. Strength can't be taught. It must be built through practice and training. These gods watch over their faithful and encourage them to observe and emulate their indomitable strength, for though they will never equal it, they can aspire to mimicry. They invite the faithful to scrutinize every move and practice what they see.
