        <h1>Winter Domain</h1>
        The gods of winter are powerful forces of nature. Some of these deities, such as Auril and Thrym, use their power to spread icy death and famine across the land and freezing all life in their path. Yet others, like Ulutiu and Rellavar Danuvien, seek champions to protect the cycle of nature and to guide their followers through harsh winters and icy terrain.<br><br>
Whether to bring destruction or guard the defenseless, clerics of this domain channel the power of the unyielding winter. Where many fear the bite of winter, they embrace the blessings of ice and cold to slow their enemies and protect their allies from harm.

<h2>Bonus Proficiency</h2>
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.
<h2>Winter's Protection</h2>
Beginning at 1st level, when you cast the armor of agathys spell, it has a range of touch instead of self. Additionally, the temporary hit points granted by the spell increases by a number equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Ice Prison</h2>
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to encase a creature in ice. As an action, you brandish your holy symbol, and force a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Strength saving throw. A willing creature can choose to fail their saving throws against this feature.<br><br>
On a failed saving throw, the creature is encased in ice for 1 minute, or until you dispel it with an action. While encased in this way, the creature is immune to all damage, is incapacitated, and its speed becomes 0. At the end of each of its turn it can repeat the Strength saving throw, breaking free of the ice on a success.
<h2>Glacial Soul</h2>
At 6th level, the divine ice shines through you. You gain resistance to cold damage.<br><br>
Additionally, whenever you deal cold damage to a creature, you can also reduce its movement speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
<h2>Divine Strike</h2>
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
<h2>Gale of Obscurity</h2>
Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to summon a blizzard that obscures the vision of other creatures. For the duration, the gale surrounds you, and a 15-foot radius area around you is heavily obscured for 1 minute or until you dismiss it using a bonus action. You and creatures of your choice can see through the gale as normal.<br><br>
You may use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all uses when you finish a long rest.
