        <h1>Sorrow Domain</h1>
        The Sorrow domain is concerned with sadness, grief, loss, despair, solitude, and loneliness. Gods of this domain might preside over those suffering from sorrow and aid them in understanding their pain and seeing hope at the end of their path. Other gods might seek to sow despair and sadness, thriving in the pain and grief that it brings.<br><br>
Gods of the Sorrow Domain embody strife (Eris and Yurtrus), suffering (Ilmater and Jergal), and misery (Achlys and Oizys). Clerics of this domain often frequent areas rife with despair and loss. Also called mourners, they often perform the duties of funeral rites, laments, and elegies. They seek to aid those in their time of mourning and grief, while also bringing woe and misery to those who would cause harm. These clerics may also adorn themselves with symbols of sadness, such as barren trees, gray roses, or teardrops.

<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
Starting at 1st level you gain proficiency with heavy armor and in your choice of either Insight or Persuasion.
<h2>Empathic Awareness</h2>
Beginning when you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the ability to take upon yourself the suffering of others. You gain the guidance cantrip if you don't already know it. Whenever a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet would take damage, you may use your reaction to redirect half the damage to yourself. Only the original target suffers any additional effects of the damage.<br><br>
You may use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Wave of Despair</h2>
Starting at 2nd level, as an action, you can present your holy symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to unleash a wave of despair that ripples outward from you. Choose a number of creatures up to your Wisdom modifier within 30 feet of you. These creatures must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your cleric spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 psychic damage and the creature must spend its action on its turn wallowing in sadness and grief for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
<h2>Mind of Gloom</h2>
Starting at 6th level your experiences with sorrow and woe has hardened you against life's misery and mental stress, granting you the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>You gain resistance to psychic damage.</li>
<li>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened as well as against short-term or long-term madness effects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Divine Strike</h2>
Starting at 8th level you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level the extra damage increases to 2d8.
<h2>Purveyor of Sorrow</h2>
Starting at 17th level the sorrow surrounding you causes others to hesitate in harming you. Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack against you, the attack roll is made with disadvantage.
