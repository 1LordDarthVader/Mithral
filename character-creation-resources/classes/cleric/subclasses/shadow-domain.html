<h1>Shadow Domain</h1>

Followers of Shadow worship many gods. Some are gods of twilight and dusk that work in tandem with the forces of the natural world. Others are sinister gods worshiped by those that live deep underground, who fear and despise the light of day above all else. Whether good or evil, clerics of Shadow wield the darkness as an extension of themselves, using its power to sow fear and confusion. They blot out the light and instill terror in any who work against the will of their gods.

<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and the Stealth skill.

<h2>Creeping Death</h2>
Also at 1st level, once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can call on death to edge ever closer. The next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, and deals an additional 1d6 necrotic damage on a hit.

<br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Channel Divinity: Cloying Darkness</h2>
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to conjure a cloud of darkness to billow around you, banishing light and draining the life of your foes. As an action, you present your holy symbol and all light sources within 30 feet are extinguished, and magical lights produced by a spell of a level equal to half your cleric level or lower are dispelled.

<br><br>In addition, creatures of your choice within 30 feet must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes necrotic damage equal to 2d6 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and loses any darkvision they have for 1 minute.

<br><br>On a successful save, they take half as much damage and suffer no other effects. A creature can repeat this saving throw at the start of each of its turns, regaining their darkvision on a success.

<h2>Shadow's Scorn</h2>
Starting at 6th level, when you deal damage to a creature you may choose to dispel any shadows that conceal it. The affected creature can’t benefit from being invisible, has its speed reduced by 10 feet, and if the creature is a shapeshifter it immediately shifts to its original form and can’t assume a different form for 1 minute.

<h2>Divine Strike</h2>
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

<h2>Nightstalker</h2>
Beginning at 17th level, when you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or are in an area of bright light.
