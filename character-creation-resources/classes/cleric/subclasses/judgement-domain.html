        <h1>Judgement Domain</h1>
        A Judgment Domain cleric is a cleric who oversees the distribution of law and order. They may do so in the name Justice itself, at the behest of an institution of justice in the land, or in service to a particular face of justice. Gods of the Judgement Domain exemplify order and lawfulness, and the pursuit of reparations and retributions. This includes Tyr, Forseti, Helm, Torm, or even Asmodeus and Bane for those that dispense the Iron Fist of Tyranny upon the world.<br><br>
Some Judgement clerics are ruthless in their pursuit of the higher ideal of justice, while others are more forgiving. Clerics of this domain often act as judges, lawyers, and investigators.

<h2>Bonus Cantrip</h2>
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the Sacred Flame cantrip if you don't already know it.
<h2>Sacred Judgment</h2>
Starting at 1st level, when deal damage to a creature with a cleric spell, you can apply additional damage to a creature equal to your spellcasting ability modifier if that target has dealt damage to another creature since the end of your last turn.<br><br>
You use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, regaining all expended uses on a long rest. If a spell effects multiple creatures, you can apply Sacred Judgement to multiple targets, but each application counts as a separate use of the ability.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Chains of Reckoning</h2>
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to invoke judgement upon your enemies. As an action, you present your holy symbol, causing a creature you can see within 60 feet of you to be crushed beneath the weight of their sins. For 1 minute, you can apply the bonus damage of Sacred Judgement to that creature when dealing damage with a cleric spell.<br><br>
The chosen creature must also make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone and their movement speed becomes 0 for 1 minute. The creature can repeat their saving throw at the end of each of their turns. If the creature has dealt damage since the start of their turn, they make this save at disadvantage.
<h2>Divine Retribution</h2>
Starting at 6th level, when an allied creature within 60 feet of you takes damage from another creature while under the effect of a sanctuary spell you cast, or if they are reduced to 0 hit points, you can cast hellish rebuke against the attacker at its lowest level without expending a spell slot.<br><br>
You can do this a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and regain all uses on a long rest.
<h2>Potent Cantrip</h2>
Starting at 8th level, you add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
<h2>Eternal Judgement</h2>
Starting at 17th level, your Sacred Judgement can be used an unlimited number of times.
