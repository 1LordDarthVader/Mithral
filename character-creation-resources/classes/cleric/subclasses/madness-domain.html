        <h1>Madness Domain</h1>
        Clerics who follow the Madness Domain pursue the deities and god-like beings of foreign realms governed by utterly alien and incomprehensible laws of magic and physics that would send most mortal minds spiraling into delusion and hysteria.

<h2>Aberrant Gift</h2>
At 1st level, you learn to speak and understand Deep Speech, and you learn the Minor Illusion cantrip. For you, this cantrip counts as a cleric cantrip.
<h2>Phase Step</h2>
Also at 1st level, you gain the ability to move through other creatures as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn in another creature's space, you take 1d10 force damage and are pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.<br><br>
When you move through a hostile creature's space in this way, you can use your bonus action to pierce the creature's mind with imagery of terrifying eyes and inky, black tentacles. If the target is not an aberration, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or take 2d8 psychic damage. Whether your target succeeds or fails on this saving throw, it can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.<br><br>
You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Far Rift</h2>
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity as an action to present your holy symbol and open up a rift in space. Choose a point centered on an unoccupied 10-foot cube within 60 feet of you. The rift appears as a 5-foot radius sphere of blackness with long, lashing tendrils.<br><br>
Choose a number of creatures you can see up to your spellcasting ability modifier within 30 feet of the sphere. Each target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be pulled 20 feet toward the sphere. A creature that is pulled into the sphere's space takes psychic damage equal to 2d8 + your cleric level. The rift then closes.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Bend Space</h2>
When you reach 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to manipulate the fabric of space itself. Whenever you or a friendly creature within 30 feet of you would be hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to warp the space between the target of the attack and another willing creature you can see within 30 feet of you. If both chosen creatures are Large or smaller, you teleport the two creatures, exchanging their positions and forcing the attack to target the other creature. The new target of the attack gains a +2 bonus to AC against the attack, as the sudden swap confounds the attacker.
<h2>Potent Spellcasting</h2>
Starting at 8th level, you add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
<h2>Impart Madness</h2>
Starting at 17th level, whenever a creature takes damage from your Phase Step or Far Rift, you can bestow an effect of madness on that creature which lasts for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, it can make an Intelligence saving throw against your cleric spell save DC, ending the effect on a success.<br><br>
Roll on the Short-Term Madness table to determine the effect produced.
