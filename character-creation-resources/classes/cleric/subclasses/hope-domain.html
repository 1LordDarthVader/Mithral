        <h1>Hope Domain</h1>
        When times grow dire and the evening din seems impenetrable, clerics of the Hope Domain do their resolute work. These clerics of righteous deities embody bravery and resilience, always determined to continue when the path seems dark, protecting their allies in the heat of battle and bolstering their resolve against the strongest of adversaries.<br><br>
Gods of the Hope Domain include Angharradh, Chauntea, Ilmater and Bahamut. These are usually beings who hold firm to their beliefs of protection, honor, and integrity no matter the situation, and encourage the ideals of kindness and courage even in the face of calamity.

<h2>Bonus Proficiency</h2>
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.
<h2>Preserve Life</h2>
From 1st level, you can protect yourself and others with a powerful shield. If you or an allied creature you can see within 30 feet is hit with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to increase the targets AC against the triggering attack, potentially causing the attack to miss. The bonus equals your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1).<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Rally</h2>
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to inspire an ally with resolve and hope.<br><br>
As an action, you can present your holy symbol and select a creature you can see within 60 feet. Until the end of your next turn, the target makes all attack rolls and saving throws with advantage.
<h2>Bastion of Hope</h2>
Starting at 6th level, when an attack roll is made against you and misses you, you can choose to gain temporary hit points equal to your cleric level. These temporary hit points last until the beginning of your next turn.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Student of Optimism</h2>
Also at 6th level, you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
<h2>Divine Strike</h2>
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
<h2>Supreme Healing</h2>
Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.
