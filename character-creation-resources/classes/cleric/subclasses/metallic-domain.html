        <h1>Metallic Domain</h1>
        The dragon gods are mighty beings that hold the loyalty of some of the most powerful creatures in existence. But their influence is not limited to just those mighty beings. Lesser followers of Bahamut, the god of metallic dragons, are just dedicated to the destruction of evil, and to acting against the machinations of the chromatic dragons and their queen as their draconic patrons. In pursuit of this, Metallica domain clerics are granted powers that emulate those abilities most iconic to dragons.<br><br>
The variety of metallic dragons and the ideals and motivations that they live by can have a great influence on the cleric that wishes to embody them in their clerical duties. A cleric who takes after a silver dragon will be more friendly and open to all; while a cleric who takes after a bronze dragon will be more belligerent and wrathful towards their enemies.

<h2>Draconic Teachings</h2>
At 1st level, when you choose this domain, you learn how to speak draconic and one other language of your choice. In addition, you choose which color of dragon you choose to represent in your clerical duties to Bahamut. This tells you what ideals you will follow and which breath weapon you get when you reach 2nd level in this class.

<h2>Channel Divinity: Dragon's Breath</h2>
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your channel divinity to unleash a breath attack.<br><br>
As an action, you bring your holy symbol to your lips and summon the wrath of a dragon, and let loose a breath weapon whose area and damage type are described in the color of dragon you chose. Each creature your breath weapon hits must make a dexterity saving throw against your spell DC. On a failed save they take 3d6 damage of the chosen color or half as much on a successful save.<br><br>
You number of d6s you roll for this ability damage increases by 1d6 at 5th level, then again at 8th, 11th and 14th level.
<h2>Dragon's Hide</h2>
At 6th level, you gain the natural physical toughness of dragon kind, allowing you to face your enemies with all the confidence a dragon would.<br><br>
While you are not wearing any armor, your ac is 10 + your Constitution + your spellcasting ability modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.<br><br>
You also gain resistance to the damage type of your chosen dragon's breath weapon.
<h2>Divine Strike</h2>
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage. This damage is the same as your chosen dragon's breath weapon. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
<h2>Dragon Form</h2>
Starting at 17th level, you can spend a 9th level spell slot in order to cast the Shapechange spell. However, you can only transform into an adult version of the dragon color you chose when you cast the spell this way.
