<h1>Pain Domain</h1>

The world is filled with pain and torment, and the best that one can do is to endure and deal as much pain back to those who offend. The gods of suffering teach that suffering is a real, inescapable part of life. Pain tests all, but gives strength of spirit to the hardy and the true.

<br><br>The gods of suffering are patrons of those who undergo great hardship, torment, or persecution. Clerics of these deities can use their magic to take the burdens from others and return agony to the guilty. Deities of this domain include gods of pain such as Iuz the Old, Ilmater the Crying God and Loviatar the Maiden of Pain, as well as gods of vengeance like Nemesis.

<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
Starting at 1st level you gain proficiency with martial weapons.

<h2>Shared Suffering</h2>
Beginning when you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the ability to take upon yourself the suffering of others. You gain the blade ward cantrip if you don't already know it.

<br><br>Whenever a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet would take damage, you may use your reaction to redirect half the damage to yourself, before any resistances. Only the original target suffers any additional effects of the damage.

<br><br>You may use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all uses when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Channel Divinity: Tendrils of Agony</h2>
Starting at 2nd level, as an action, you can present your holy symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to unleash a wave of agony that ripples outward from you. Choose a number of creatures up to your Wisdom modifier within 30 feet of you. These creatures must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your cleric spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes psychic damage equal to 2d6 + your cleric level and the creature is incapacitated for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

<br><br>An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

<h2>Hardened by Pain</h2>
Starting at 6th level your experiences with pain has hardened you against life's misery and stress, granting you the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>You gain resistance to psychic damage.</li>
    <li>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened as well as against short-term or long-term madness effects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Divine Strike</h2>
Starting at 8th level you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level the extra damage increases to 2d8.

<h2>Decree of Pain</h2>
Beginning at 17th level, you may use your Shared Suffering feature an unlimited number of times.

<br><br>Additionally, when you use your Shared Suffering feature to redirect damage, you can redirect the damage to another creature you can see within 30 feet of you instead of yourself. An unwilling creature can resist the effect by making a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, preventing the damage redirection on a successful save.
