<h2>Forceful Gale</h2>
At 1st level, you gain the ability to manipulate the winds. You learn the gust cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. For you, it gains the following changes:
<ul>
<li>One Large or smaller creature that you choose must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be flung up 20 feet directly away from you and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.</li>
<li>You create a blast of air capable of moving one object that weighs no more than 100 pounds. If the object is being held or carried, the holder must make a Strength saving throw or lose hold of it. The object is pushed up to 60 feet away from you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tailwind</h2>
Also at 1st level, the blessing of your god grants you unmatched grace and mobility. Your movement speed increases by 10 feet if you are not wearing medium or heavy armor.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Updraft</h2>
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create a powerful blast of wind. As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Choose a Large or smaller creature within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be blown upwards up to 30 feet. A target can choose to automatically fail this saving throw. If the target doesn't have a hover or fly speed, it immediately falls afterwards, taking fall damage and landing prone.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Protection of Wind</h2>
At 6th level, the gusts and breezes protect you from harm. As a reaction when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack you can see, you can use your Channel Divinity to create a gust of wind around you, causing the attack to miss.
<h2>Potent Spellcasting</h2>
Starting at 8th level, you add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
<h2>Blessed Wings</h2>
At 17th level, your god places upon you the blessing of true flight. You grow a pair of wings, which grant you a flying speed of 60 feet. If you already have a flying speed, it increases to 90 feet, unless it is already higher. You can't use these wings while wearing medium or heavy armor.
