        <h1>Circle of the Sun</h1>
        Druids revere aspects aspects of nature, and none is more central the cycle of life than the sun, origin of light and life. Druids of this circle are not clerics of the god of the sun, but represent it's aspect in the cycle of life, the light and heat and it brings, the fiery radiance with which it reigns over the world. They draw directly from the Elemental Plane of Fire and from the upper planes.<br><br>
Druids of the Circle often stand in opposition that with crawls through the dark, that which corrupts in the absence of light, and while still inclined to the neutrality many Druids uphold, they tend to swing further the extremes of passion and action. They aren't afraid to leave the wilderness they call home and go on vast journeys to achieve their goals.
<h2>Circle Spells</h2>
At 2nd level, you learn the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=464">Light</a> and <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=169">Create Bonfire</a> cantrips. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Sun Spells table. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

<h2>Unleash Radiance</h2>
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain an alternate use for Wild Shape. You absorb sunlight and as a bonus action, you can unleash the radiance within. When you transform with this ability, creatures within 15 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the start of your next turn. For the next one minute you gain the following effects:
<ul>
<li>You shed bright light in a radius of 15 feet, and dim light for another 15 feet. The bright light is sunlight.</li>
<li>You when you would take fire or radiant damage, you can instead gain temporary hit points equal to the damage you would have taken, up to a total of your Druid level. Once you have gained temporary hit points this way up to your Druid level, you no longer gain temporary hit points and gain resistance to fire and radiant damage.</li>
<li>Once per turn, when you deal fire or radiant damage on your turn, you can deal an addition 1d4 fire or radiant damage to that enemy.</li>
</ul>
As an action while you are transformed, you can end the effect early, releasing your stored energy in a beam of light a 60 feet long and 5 wide. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, or take 1d12 radiant damage. You can enhance this damage further by expending a 1st level spell slot (to 2d12), and by an additional 1d12 per level of spell slot spent (3d12 for 2nd level spell slot, 4d12 for a 3rd level, etc), up to 6d12 for a 5th level spell slot.<br><br>
If you have not been exposed to sunlight in the last 24 hours, the duration of the transformation is halved, and ending it early does not release a beam of energy.
<h2>Burning Light</h2>
Starting at 6th level, once per turn on your turn, when you roll fire or radiant damage against a creature that is in bright light, you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to one roll of that damage. Additionally some of your fire spells are enhanced in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>When make an attack with flame blade, you can make a second attack as part of the same action.</li>
<li>You can concentrate on multiple create bonfire spells at the same time, up to your spellcasting ability modifier spells.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cleansing Fire</h2>
Beginning at 10th level, you can cast remove curse or lessor restoration without expending a spell slot, if the target has a condition or curse removed by the spell, they take 1d10 fire damage and 1d10 radiant damage.<br><br>
You can do this a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, regaining all uses when you complete a long rest.
<h2>Emissary of the Sun</h2>
Starting at 14th level, when you use Unleash Radiance, you partially become fire itself, and you are under the effect of investiture of flame.<br><br>
Additionally, you can expend two uses of wild shape when you activate Unleash Radiance to grow wings of flame, taking on a phoenix-like form and gaining a fly speed of 30 feet in addition to the rest of the effects.
