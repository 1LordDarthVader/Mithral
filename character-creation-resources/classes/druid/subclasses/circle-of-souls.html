        <h1>Circle of Souls</h1>
        Druids of the Circle of the Souls, also known as shamans, are mystics who summon forth the spirits of dead mortals to converse with the living. These shamans serve as a link between the living and the dead, and unlike other mystics, commune with forces that are not strictly benevolent.<br><br>
These druids will gather at sacred sites, often in caves or high on mountain slopes where the walls between the planes wear thin to maintain their traditional ceremonies and channel the power of their elders. Their rituals call on the spirits of ages past to inhabit their bodies, allowing heroes and villains alike thought long dead to exert their influence anew in the waking world. By invoking their magic to part the ethereal veil, these druids draw power from ancient kings, regretful commoners, or even mystical monstrosities.
<h2>Circle Spells</h2>
