        <h1>Circle of the Hybrid</h1>
        Druids of the Circle of the Hybrid are natural innovators. They mark the thin line between humanoid and beast, daring to combine the finest qualities of each and striving to push that boundary as far as possible.
<h2>Hybrid Shape</h2>
Beginning at 2nd level, you learn to measure the influence of the natural world on your body. When you use your Wild Shape, you can partially transform into a beast instead of magically assuming its shape.<br><br>
While partially transformed, you gain the benefit of the beast's senses, speeds, and special traits, except for any flying speed the beast has. If the beast is larger than you, you grow to its size. Anything you are wearing or carrying grows with you. None of your other statistics change, and you retain the ability to speak, cast spells, and use any features from your class, race, or other source.<br><br>
For the duration, you can use your action to take one of the actions in the beast's stat block. You are proficient with the beast's natural weapons. You can use your spellcasting ability, instead of the beast's attack modifier, for the attack and damage rolls of attacks you make with them, and can use your druid spell save DC instead of any of the beast's DCs. In addition, whenever you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use the beast's statistics or your own (your choice).
<h2>Forced Adaptation</h2>
At 6th level, you gain the ability to force your body to adapt to new environments. When you finish a short or long rest, you can choose one type of terrain from the Forced Evolution table, adapting to that terrain until you choose a different one with this feature.<br><br>
You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks you make within the terrain you chose, and you're naturally adapted to the environment associated with it.

<h2>Primal Strike</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your attacks with a beast's natural weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
<h2>Lusus Naturae</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can expend two uses of your Wild Shape at the same time to partially transform into two beasts using your Hybrid Shape.<br><br>
You gain the benefit of both beast's senses, speeds, and special traits. If both beasts have the same type of speed, use whichever is higher. If both beasts have flying speed, you also gain the faster of the two flying speeds. If either beast is larger than you, you become the size of the largest beast. You can take the actions in either beast's stat block, and you can make ability checks and saving throws using either beast's statistics.
<h2>Master of Two Worlds</h2>
Beginning at 14th level, you master the balance between humanoid and beast. When you use your action to cast a druid spell while partially transformed by your Hybrid Shape, you can use your bonus action to take one of the actions in the beast's stat block.
