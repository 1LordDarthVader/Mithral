        <h1>Circle of the Woods</h1>
        While many druids have a kinshape with the deep woods of nature, a Circle of the Woods Druid has a connection that can go much deeper, where some may wonder where the wild of the woods ends and the will of the druid starts. Legends say that the first of these druids were trees who took human form, rather than humans that took tree form, but such things are lost to legend.<br><br>
Frequently, regardless of the nature of their connection, these druids will feel most comfortable deep in nature, and place great value in its unspoiled form, sharing a world view more in common with dyrads and treants than other mortals.
<h2>Circle Spells</h2>
At 2nd level, you learn the shillelagh cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Wood Spells table. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

<h2>Wood Shape</h2>
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain an alternate use for Wild Shape. As a bonus action, you assume a treelike form, covered in leaves and bark, which lasts up to one hour, or until you end it as a bonus action or until you are incapacitated.<br><br>
You gain the following properties when you transform:
<ul>
<li>Your size becomes Large. Your attacks gain Reach.</li>
<li>You gain a natural weapon that is a club under the effect of Shillelagh. While in this form, you can cast shillelagh on any weapon you are carrying.</li>
<li>You can make an Athletics check using your spellcasting ability check to initiate, maintain, or contest a grapple, and have a number of grappling appendages (in the form of grasping roots or branches) equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.</li>
<li>You gain natural armor with AC of 10 + your Constitution modifier + your Dexterity modifier. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.</li>
<li>You gain temporary hit points equal to twice your Druid level, which disappear when the form ends.</li>
<li>Your speed becomes 15 feet, unless the speed was lower.</li>
</ul>
You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. The GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment. Any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
<h2>Extra Attack</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
<h2>Ancient Fortitude</h2>
Beginning at 10th level, you gain the endurance of the of the ancient forests. While in Wood shape, if you have no temporary hit points at the start of your turn, you gain temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.<br><br>
Additionally, if you have any temporary hit points when you take damage that forces you to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can make the check with advantage.
<h2>Guardian's Grasp</h2>
Starting at 14th level, any creature grappled or restrained by you by a grapple or a spell you cast takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage at the start of their turn as your grasp crushes them.
