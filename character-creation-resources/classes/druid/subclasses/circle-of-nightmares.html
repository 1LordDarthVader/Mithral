        <h1>Circle of Nightmares</h1>
        Druids of the circle of nightmares often hail from regions that a rife with horrific monsters, and unspeakable terrors. They understand through rough experience that the best way to fight to unnatural is to is to become unnatural themselves. Druids of this circle corrupt the power of their wild shape to turn into horrific parodies of beasts that they use to ight the monstrosities and aberrations that would otherwise overpower them.<br><br>
They can turn their beast forms into slavering, every-hungry monsters that regenerate from eating the flesh of their enemies. Or they can turn their beast forms into dark, undetectable shadows that stalk from the darkness and ambush even the most perceptive of foes. Yet still others turn into beasts forms of sadistic, cackling beasts who claws cause unimaginable pain and who can sense weakness and suffering.
<h2>Nightmarish Wild Shape</h2>
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you can use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.<br><br>
Additionally, you can choose a form of nightmare that you want to manifest in your beast form. Choose one of the following types of nightmares below. Creatures you wild shape into take on a horrid appearance based on the nightmare you choose and gain an additional feature in addition to any others they have.
<ul>
<li><strong>Darkness.</strong> Your beast form is hard to see and even harder to spot, invoking the fear of darkness and the unknown. Creatures you wild shape into have advantage on stealth checks, and they can make one additional attack against a creature that is surprised when they first make an attack against them.</li>
<li><strong>Hunger.</strong> Your beast form takes on a slavering, voracious demeanor that invokes the fear of being eaten. Creatures you wild shape into gain a +10 bonus to their walking or lying speeds, and once per turn, when they deal damage with any kind of bite attack, they gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. Additional damage dealt by abilities or spells other than the bite attack is not counted when gaining these hit points.</li>
<li><strong>Malice.</strong> Your beast form exudes a grinning, sadistic countenance, invoking the fear of pain and torture. Creatures you wild shape into can tell if another creature is below or above half their maximum hit points. If they are below half, then they can re-roll all 1s and 2s once on any damage rolls they make against them.</li>
</ul>
Regardless of what nightmare you pick, your beast form gains a bonus to its hit point maximum equal to twice your druid level and its uses your spell attack bonus on all of their attacks.
<h2>Dark Aspects</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non magical attacks and damage.<br><br>
Additionally, both you and your beast gain a magical benefit based on the nightmare of you chose at 2nd level.
<ul>
<li><strong>Darkness.</strong> You can hide where others can't. You count as being in complete darkness while in dim light, and you count as being in dim light while in bright light.</li>
<li><strong>Hunger.</strong> You can smell if creatures, other than you or your allies, are within 120 feet of you. You don't know their exact location, but you can sense if there is one, a few, or many creatures. You can also smell if they are wary or on guard.</li>
<li><strong>Malice.</strong> Creature you damage with weapons and spell attacks cannot take the dash action, and their jumping and leaping distances are halved until the end of their next turn.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Monstrous Wild Shape</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to transform into a beast of up to CR 5.<br><br>
If you do this, hostile creature within 30 feet of you, that can see you, must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they become frightened of you until the end of their next turn and must spend their turn taking the dash action and moving away from you.
<h2>Ultimate Nightmare</h2>
Starting at 14th level, your beast form gains a magical benefit based on the nightmare you chose at 2nd level.
<ul>
<li><strong>Darkness.</strong> Creatures you wild shape into double their movement speed while in complete darkness.</li>
<li><strong>Hunger.</strong> Creatures you wild shape into can grapple targets they hit with any kind of bite attack.</li>
<li><strong>Malice.</strong> The first time a creatures you wild shape into hits a creature with an attack on their turn, the attack causes the target to bleed. This causes the target creature to take the same damage dealt by that attack again at the start of their next turn.</li>
</ul>
