<h1>Hellwalker Conclave</h1>

You are a Hellwalker, a ranger that is cloaked in the magic of the Lower Planes. A Hellwalker specializes in living in harsh, dry conditions of the world. These rangers are accustomed to the extreme temperatures of such environments.

<h2>Hellwalker Magic</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Hellwalker Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

<h2>Damning Strike</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you imbue your strikes with the neverending flames of the Lower Planes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is marked for 1 minute and takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. A creature can only be affected by one instance of this feature at a time.

<br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Cursed Tongue</h2>
Also at 3rd level, your fiendish affinity allows you to speak, read and write Abyssal and Infernal.

<h2>Burning Constitution</h2>
At 7th level, you gain the resistance to the environment of the lower planes. You gain resistance to fire damage. If you already have resistance to fire damage, you can instead choose one from the following: cold, necrotic, poison, or psychic.

<h2>Mark of the Damned</h2>
Starting at 11th level, you are able to use your hellish power to brand a creature. As a bonus action, you can choose a creature that has been marked by your Damning Strike feature. While marked, the chosen creature suffers from the following effects:

<ul>
    <li>It takes 1d8 fire damage at the start of its turns instead of 1d6.</li>
    <li>It becomes frightened of you.</li>
    <li>It loses resistance against your attacks and abilities that deal fire damage.</li>
    <li>You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects made by it.</li>
</ul>

You can only have one creature affected by this feature at a time.

<h2>Fiendish Spawn</h2>
When you reach 15th level, your hellish magic has granted you limited command over the damned creatures that inhabit the Lower Planes. You can cast summon fiend as a 6th-level spell without expending a spell slot or material components. When you cast in this way, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute.

<br><br>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until the end of a long rest.
