        <h1>Lightcaller Conclave</h1>
        Since the dawn of time, mankind has feared the darkness. Ranger belonging to the Lightcaller Conclave draw their power from the positive plane to defend civilization against creatures that lurk in the gloaming. Each nurse a bright ember that burns against the night. What terror lays in the darkest corners of the night are the Lightcaller's quarry, for the night should provide solace and calmness, not fear. These rangers often ally with celestials, and wield their light like extensions of their body.<br><br>
Lightcaller Magic
At 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Beast Master Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

<h2>Light Motes</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you learn to conjure motes of light. As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot to conjure motes of light that encircle you. You conjure two motes with a 1st-level spell slot, creating one additional mote for each spell level higher than 1st. You can have a number of motes equal to half your ranger level (rounded up). Any additional motes you create disappear. These motes last until they are used or until you finish a long rest.<br><br>
If you have three or more motes remaining, they shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you have one or two motes remaining, they shed dim light in a 20-foot radius.<br><br>
You can expend a mote to make a ranged spell attack that you can use with the Attack action. The attack has a range of 120 feet, and on a hit the target takes 2d6 radiant damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.
<h2>Radiant Armaments</h2>
At 3rd level, your strikes become imbued with the power of the dawn. You learn the three Radiant techniques.
<ul>
<li><strong>Guiding Shot.</strong> As a bonus action, you can expend a mote to imbue a piece of ammunition with light. The ammunition sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius until the end of your next turn. When you hit a creature with this piece of ammunition, it takes an additional 1d6 radiant damage, sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius until the end of your next turn, and the next attack roll made against it before the end of your next turn has advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Scattered Sparks.</strong> As an action, you can expend a mote and launch it at a point within 120 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage increases to 3d6 at 7th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 15th level.</li>
<li><strong>Twin Suns.</strong> When you miss a ranged weapon attack or ranged spell attack, you can expend a mote to use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target. On a hit, the attack deals an additional 1d6 radiant damage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Luminous Defense</h2>
At 7th level, the power of the light comes to your aid in times of need. When a creature moves within 10 feet of you for the first time on a turn, you can use your reaction to make a mote attack at the creature.
<h2>Dawnstriker</h2>
At 11th level, your attacks become infused with light. Whenever you hit a creature with a weapon attack, it takes an additional 1d6 radiant damage.
<h2>Conjure Mote</h2>
At 15th level, you learn to create light motes with your own powers. You can use an action while you have no motes to create one mote.
