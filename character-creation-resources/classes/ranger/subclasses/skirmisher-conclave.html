        <h1>Skirmisher Conclave</h1>
        You are the first, and often last, line of defense against the terrors of the wilderness. Joining the Skirmisher Conclave requires a cool mind and steady hand. You are the stalker of prey, honing your skills in the methods of tracking and finding. The land itself is your teacher and the beasts that call it home, your allies.<br><br>
You might be driven by the necessity of triumph over some great injustice or ongoing threat. Perhaps a corrupt noble extorts the countryside, a hag coven kidnaps local children on moonless nights, or a horde of gnolls threatens to destroy an ancient forest. Whatever it is that drives you, you single-mindedly put your skills, magics, tools, and techniques to the task of defeating your foe.
<h2>Skirmisher Magic</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Skirmisher Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

<h2>Spotter</h2>
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you learn to track, detect, and perform deadly strikes against fleeing targets. You can take the Search action as a bonus action, and when you hit a creature with an attack of opportunity, you deal an additional 1d8 damage.
<h2>Herbal Remedies</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you learn to use your knowledge of herbal remedies and the natural healing of the body to treat a creature's wounds. During a short rest, choose a number of willing creatures up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). For this short rest, whenever one of those creatures spends one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points, it treats any roll of less than half the maximum value on the die, as half the maximum value of the die.
<h2>Martial Instincts</h2>
Beginning at 7th level, your trained senses allow you to react quickly to the movement of enemies around you. When a creature moves within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed. You must be able to see or otherwise sense the creature to use this reaction.
<h2>Felling Blow</h2>
Starting at 11th level, your knowledge of your enemies gives you insight into disrupting their movement and abilities. Choose a creature within your weapon's range. You can use your action to make a single powerful weapon attack against that creature. You gain advantage on this attack if the creature is at least one size larger than you. If you hit, the attack deals an additional 2d8 damage and the creature must make a Strength saving throw against your ranger spell save DC or fall prone.
<h2>Ambuscade</h2>
When you reach 15th level, you have learned to master the tactics of ambush. On initiative count 20 on the first round of combat you take an extra turn in addition to the turn taken on your normal initiative count.
