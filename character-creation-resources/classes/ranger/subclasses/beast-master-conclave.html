        <h1>Beast Master Conclave</h1>
        The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast and ranger work as one to fight the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype means committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership with an animal as its companion and friend.
<h2>Beast Master Magic</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Beast Master Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

<h2>Primal Companion</h2>
        At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. It is able to understand simple speech and commands. The beast grows along with you, using your proficiency bonus (PB) as its own. The beast can be created using the <a href="../beast-companion.html">Beast Companion rules</a>. Choose traits that fit the type of creature you wish to bond with, or use one of the example stat blocks.<br><br>
In combat, the beast acts during your turn and moves at your command. It can use its reaction and bonus action (if applicable) on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can instead sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to use an Attack, Dash, Disengage or Help action. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.<br><br>
Like a player character, the beast becomes unconscious at 0 hit points and makes death saving throws. If the beast has died within the last hour, you can use an action and expend a spell slot to revive it.<br><br>
The beast also follows all resting rules that apply to player characters, including the ability to roll Hit Dice to regain hit points on a short rest.
<h2>Exceptional Training</h2>
Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when your beast companion doesn't attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to take the Dash, Disengage, or Help action on its turn. In addition, the beast's attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
<h2>Bestial Fury</h2>
Starting at 11th level, when you command your beast companion to take the Attack action, the beast can make two attacks, or it can take the Multiattack action if it has that action.
<h2>Share Spells</h2>
Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.
