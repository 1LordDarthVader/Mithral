        <h1>Hunter Conclave</h1>
        Some rangers seek to master weapons to better protect civilization from the terrors of the wilderness. Members of the Hunter Conclave learn specialized fighting techniques for use against the most dire threats, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.
<h2>Hunter's Prey</h2>
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
<ul>
<li><strong>Colossus Slayer.</strong> Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Giant Killer.</strong> When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Horde Breaker.</strong> Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hunter Magic</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Hunter Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.
