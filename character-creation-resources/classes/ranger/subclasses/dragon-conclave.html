        <h1>Dragon Conclave</h1>
        Rangers of the Dragon Conclave dedicate themselves to respecting dragons in all their ferocity and all their mysterious splendor. They learn from dragons and seek to emulate the virtues of those they align themselves with.
<h2>Dragon Conclave Magic</h2>
At 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Dragon Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

<h2>Draconic Affinity</h2>
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you irrevocably align yourself with a category of dragons. Choose either chromatic or metallic as your Draconic Affinity.<br><br>
You focus your training under one type of dragon within with your Draconic Affinity, making them your advocate. You can change your advocate when you gain a level in this class.

In addition, you can speak, read, and write Draconic, and you can use your Primeval Awareness feature to sense dragons. If there are any dragons within range of a type associated with your Draconic Affinity, you learn their exact type, age category, approximate location, and number.
<h2>Dragon Warrior</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can invoke your dragon advocate in battle. As a bonus action, you can cause up to two weapons you are holding to begin pulsing with energy for 1 minute. For the duration, when you hit a creature with an attack with one of these weapons, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the type associated with your advocate. A creature can take this extra damage only once per turn.<br><br>
The extra damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 11th level in this class.
<h2>Aspect of the Dragon</h2>
At 7th level, you can perform an ancient ritual bestowed by dragons to their allies over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You must be wearing armor while you perform the ritual.<br><br>
At the completion of the ritual, the armor you are wearing is magically reinforced by an infusion of scales of the same type as your dragon advocate. If another creature dons this armor, the scales immediately fade. While wearing this armor, you gain benefits based on your Draconic Affinity.
<ul>
<li><strong>Chromatic Affinity.</strong> You gain resistance to the damage type associated with your dragon advocate, and you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</li>
<li><strong>Gem Affinity.</strong> You can cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=481">Mage Hand</a> cantrip, and the spectral hand is invisible when you cast it. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against enchantment spells.</li>
<li><strong>Metallic Affinity.</strong> You have a +1 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on ability checks to detect and see through illusions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advocate's Presence</h2>
At 11th level, you learn to channel the fearsome presence of your draconic protector. As an action, you unleash a terrifying, guttural roar. Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. A target automatically succeeds if it can't hear or see you.<br><br>
On a failed save, a target becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Dragon Keeper</h2>
When you reach 15th level, your proven kinship with your dragon allies grants you a boon for your friendship and service. You can cast the Find Greater Steed spell using this feature, without expending a spell slot, to summon a dragon spirit to join you as a companion.<br><br>
When you cast it in this way, the spirit takes the form of a wyrmling of the same type as your dragon advocate, and its creature type is dragon rather than celestial, fey, or fiend. The wyrmling is Large, and the reach of its bite attack increases to 10 feet. It retains all other statistics.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
