        <h1>Lunar Sniper Conclave</h1>
        Lunar Snipers are a night loving hunter who find comfort in the pale light of the moon and the shadows of the night sky. They are predators who come alive when on the hunt, bearing an inhuman level of patience that allows them outlast any prey they so choose to follow.<br><br>
What's more, hiding from them is just as bad as option as running from them as the magic they carry allow to to chase even the fastest of enemies and the lunar magics they bear allows them to see into the darkest of places.
<h2>Lunar Sniper Magic</h2>
At 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Lunar Sniper Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

<h2>Eyes of Astarte</h2>
At 3rd level, the darkness is no longer an obstacle to your senses. You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.<br><br>
You also gain an excellent, pinpoint vision which allows you to see out to a mile with enough clarity to read the cover of a book at that distance.
<h2>Marks of Selene</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can mark targets for death and remain patient to strike at a greater advantage later.<br><br>
As an action, you can mark up to three creatures within 120ft of you. Creatures you mark this way emit a soft glow only you can see. This gives you a +5 bonus on Perception checks made to spot them and advantage on all attacks made against them. The marks last for up to 8 hours.<br><br>
The first time hit a creature marked this way on your turn, you deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage to them. At 11th level, this increases to 2d8 damage.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest
<h2>Dance of Diana</h2>
At 7th level, you've learned to keep your enemies at a good distance, even in the middle of combat. If you take damage from a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport up to 20ft away. If the creature that attacked you is marked with a Mark of Selene, you can make a ranged attack against them as part of the reaction, after you teleport.
<h2>Whispers of Ishtar</h2>
At 11th level, the moon has given you the ability to see as it can and give your bow the power to strike where ever it can rest. As an action, you can ready a special ranged attack with a bow or crossbow. While you have this attack readied, you know the exact location of every creature within 300ft of you even if they are behind full cover or invisible. You can then make the ranged attack at any time, no action required.<br><br>
The attack ignores full cover, and the radiant power of the attack allows it to penetrate up to 10ft of stone or 2ft of metal. If the attack hits, the target takes additional radiant damage equal to your ranger level.<br><br>
Creatures who are hidden from divination magic, or have at least 15ft of stone between you and them are not revealed to you.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.
<h2>Phoebe's Clairvoyance</h2>
At 15th level, you regularly receive knowledge from the moon, telling you about the past present, and future. This gives you many a moment of déjà vu. You can no longer be surprised. Additionally, whenever ever creature makes an attack against you, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 3 or 4, you take half damage. On a 5 or 6, the attack misses, regardless of its roll.
