        <h1>Spellbreaker Conclave</h1>
        Magic tempts, magic corrupts. Where there is power, there are those who would abuse it. Spellbreakers are a small, but dedicated conclave of ranger who specialize in hunting down evil spellcasters. While others may ignore the dangers of magic or succumb to its siren call of power, these rangers devote their life to rooting out witches and those who would wield magic for sinister and selfish means.<br><br>
Trained in ways to both track and defend against mages, most spellbreakers operate in the shadows, only revealing themselves when success is a certainty. They know all too well the magical might that burns over the helpless or wrestles control from the mind. When one wrong move could end in disintegration, there is no room for error.
<h2>Spellbreaker Magic</h2>
At 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Beast Master Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
At 3rd level, you become proficient in your choice of two of the following skills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion.
<h2>Mage Hunter</h2>
When you adopt this archetype at 3rd level you gain the skills necessary to hunt spellcasters of all kinds. You can use a bonus action to mark a creature you can see within 30 feet of you as your quarry, heightening your abilities against them. For 1 minute, or until the creature dies, you die, or you are incapacitated, the following conditions apply:
<ul>
<li>You learn the target's spellcasting ability (if it has one), and the level of the highest spell it can cast.</li>
<li>The first time each turn that you hit the target with a weapon attack, you can force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on the next spell attack that it makes.</li>
<li>You cannot be frightened or possessed by the target while you are conscious, and you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed by them.</li>
<li>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Arcane Defense</h2>
Starting at 7th level, your blood has developed an innate magical ward. When you are forced to make a saving throw for a spell or other magical effect, you gain a bonus to the roll equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).
<h2>Spellbreaker Technique</h2>
At 11th level, you have learned how to render magical effects useless. You gain the following abilities that you can use once per turn to augment your weapon attacks.
<ul>
<li><strong>Dispelling Strike.</strong> When you hit a creature that is under the effects of a spell or other magical effect with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 2d8 force damage and you can make a Wisdom check. The DC equals 10 + the spell or magical effect's level. On a successful check, the spell or magical effect affecting the creature ends.</li>
<li><strong>Disrupting Strike.</strong> When you hit a creature that is concentrating on a spell with a weapon attack, you deal an extra 2d8 force damage and force them to have disadvantage on the Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.</li>
</ul>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Inquisitor's Resolve</h2>
Upon reaching 15th level, your training as a Spellbreaker has reached its apex, and your resolve pushes you to fight on. When a spell or other magical effect reduces you to 0 hit points but does not kill you outright, you can instead drop to a number of hit points equal to your ranger level. Until the end of your next turn, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
