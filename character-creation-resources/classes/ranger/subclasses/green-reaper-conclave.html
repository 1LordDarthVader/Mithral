<h1>Green Reaper Conclave</h1>

Green Reapers specialize in a school of assassination that specializes in harvesting and catalyzing the toxic elements of flora and fauna. These rangers often work as killers for hire utilizing their extensive knowledge of toxins to end their marks' lives discreetly or with gory panache, depending on the poison used and the client's wishes. Green Reapers exhibit a morbid curiosity when encountering a toxic substance they're unfamiliar with, typically followed by an enthusiastic application of the toxin on the next foe they encounter.

<h2>Green Reaper Magic</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Hunter Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

<h2>Envenomed Attack</h2>

At 3rd level, you can use your poisoner's kit as a bonus action to coat a weapon or up to 20 pieces of ammunition with a dose of toxic poison. For the next minute, each time you deal damage with the weapon or ammunition, you deal an additional 1d4 poison damage. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and expended uses of this feature are recovered at the end of a long rest.

<br><br>At 11th level, this additional damage increases to 2d4. Also, the expended uses of this feature are recovered at the end of a short or long rest.

<h2>Toxic Tradecraft</h2>

Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with poisoner's kits. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check that uses this proficiency. Additionally, whenyou gain this feature, you also gain a poisoner's kit. If you ever lose this kit, you can spend 8 hours creating a replacement by collecting toxic flora and harvesting venomous fauna.

<br><br>Finally, once per turn when you hit a creature with a weapon or ammunition enhanced by your Envenomed Attack feature, you can spend a spell slot to apply a magical toxin to the attack. The toxin deals an additional 1d6 poison damage and the creature is poisoned until the end of your next turn. The toxin has additional effects based on the spell slot expended casting the spell. These additional effects are detailed at the end of this subclass description under Toxin Effects, and they last to the end of your next turn unless otherwise noted in the description.

<h2>Poison Control</h2>
At 7th level, you gain resistance to poison damage and have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned. In addition, you can cast the protection from poison spell without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times up to your Wisdom modifier, regaining all uses when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Variegated Vexations</h2>
At 11th level, when you apply the toxin granted by your Envenomed Attack feature, you can choose to change the additional damage to acid or necrotic instead of poison.

<h2>Pain Tolerance</h2>
At 15th level, you've learned to quickly inure yourself against harm. After you take damage from an attack, you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points equal to the damage. You lose all temporary hit points gained from this feature at the end of your next turn.
