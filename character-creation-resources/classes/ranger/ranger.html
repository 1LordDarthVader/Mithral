<h1>Ranger</h1>

Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the
wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending
watch.

    <li>an herbalism kit and an equipment pack</li>
</ul>

<h3>Favored Enemy</h3>
Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy commonly encountered in the wilds.
<br><br>
Choose a type of favored enemy: beasts, fey, humanoids, monstrosities, or undead. You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks against creatures of the chosen type. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.
<br><br>
When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice, typically one spoken by your favored enemy or creatures associated with it. However, you are free to pick any language you wish to learn.

<h3>Favored Foe</h3>
At 1st level, when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can call on your mystical bond with nature to mark the target as your favored enemy for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).
<br><br>
The first time on each of your turns that you hit the favored enemy and deal damage to it, including when you mark it, you increase that damage by 1d4.
<br><br>
You can use this feature to mark a favored enemy a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<br><br>
This feature's extra damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 6th level and to 1d8 at 14th level.

<h3>Natural Explorer</h3>
You are a master of navigating the natural world, and you react with swift and decisive action when attacked. This grants you the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>You ignore difficult terrain.</li>
    <li>You have advantage on initiative rolls.</li>
    <li>On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted.</li>
</ul>

In addition, you are skilled at navigating the wilderness. You gain the following benefits when traveling for an hour or more:

<ul>
    <li>Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.</li>
    <li>Your group can't become lost except by magical means.</li>
    <li>Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li>
    <li>If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>
    <li>When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>
    <li>While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deft Explorer</h3>
At 1st level, you are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor, both in the wilderness and in dealing with others on your travels. At 1st level, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice, and you gain additional benefits at 6th and 10th levels.

<h4>Canny</h4>
Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using the chosen skill.
<br><br>
You can also speak, read, and write 2 additional languages of your choice.

<h4>Roving</h4>
Your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

<h4>Tireless</h4>
As an action, you can give yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). You can use this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<br><br>
In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1.

<h3>Fighting Style</h3>
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

<h4>Archery</h4>
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

<h4>Blind Fighting</h4>
You have blind sight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

<h4>Close Quarters Shooter</h4>
When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

<h4>Defensive Fighting</h4>
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

<h4>Druidic Warrior</h4>
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the
<a href="../../spells/classes/druid.html">druid spell list</a>. They count as ranger spells for you. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the druid spell list.

<h4>Dual Wielding</h4>
When you take the Attack action while two-weapon fighting, you can make a single additional attack with your off-hand weapon as part of your action instead of your bonus action, adding your ability modifier to the damage of this attack.

<h4>Dueling</h4>
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

<h4>Featherweight Fighting</h4>
While you are wielding only light weapons, your movement speed increases by 10 feet and you gain a +2 bonus to your damage rolls, so long as you are not wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or wielding a shield.

<h4>Melee Marksman</h4>
When you make a ranged attack targeting a creature within 5 feet of you, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll.
<br><br>
If you make a ranged attack against a creature within 5 feet, you can use a bonus action to strike the creature with your ranged weapon, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage on hit.

<h4>Strongbow</h4>
You can use your Strength score, in place of your Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls with bows. If using a composite bow, its special property changes to add your Dexterity modifier to the damage.

<h4>Thrown Weapon Fighting</h4>
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
<br><br>
In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

<h3>Spellcasting</h3>
By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.

<h4>Spell Slots</h4>
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

<h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the <a href="../../spells/classes/ranger.html">ranger spell list</a>.
<br><br>
The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
<br><br>
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature.
<br><br>
<strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier<br>
<strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or rod made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole from a living tree, or an object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals.

<h3>Primal Awareness</h3>
Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your awareness through the interconnections of nature: you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class if you don't already know them, as shown in the Primal Awareness Spells table. These spells don't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

<h3>Ranger Conclave</h3>
At 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger conclave. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

</ul>

<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

<h3>Martial Versatility</h3>
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to rangers. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.

<h3>Extra Attack</h3>
Beginning at 5th level you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

<h3>Greater Favored Enemy</h3>
At 6th level, you are ready to hunt even deadlier game. Choose a type of greater favored enemy: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fiends, or giants. You gain all the benefits against this chosen enemy that you normally gain against your favored enemy, including an additional language. Your bonus to damage rolls against all your favored enemies increases to +4.
<br><br>
Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against the spells and abilities used by a greater favored enemy.

<h3>Land's Stride</h3>
Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.
<br><br>
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the Entangle spell.

<h3>Nature's Veil</h3>
Starting at 10th level, you draw on the powers of nature to hide yourself from view briefly. As a bonus action, you can magically become invisible, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, until the start of your next turn.
<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h3>Vanish</h3>
Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

<h3>Feral Senses</h3>
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.
<br><br>
You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

<h3>Foe Slayer</h3>
At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
