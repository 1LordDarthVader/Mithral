        <h1>Medic Archetype</h1>
        A different cut entirely, few things phase a rogue that has spent time seeing the worst that the battle field has to offer - roper bites, dragon burns, acid sprays and worse - and their in depth knowledge of anatomy can cut both ways on the battlefield. It would be unwise to underestimates the deadly precision of a medic, for cutting things open was never the hard part of their job.<br><br>
Medics tend to be fastidious and educated, but where their moral compass points can vary widely on what brought them to their calling.
<h2>Paramedic Procedures</h2>
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill. If you already have proficiency with Medicine, you can choose to gain proficiency in one of History, Nature, or tool proficiency with the Herbalism Kit.<br><br>
Additionally, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to use a make a Wisdom (Medicine) check, administer or consume a Healing Potion, or use a Healer's Kit. When you use a Healer's Kit, the target regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.
<h2>Anatomical Assessment</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check targeting a creature to access its weaknesses. The DC is equal to the target's AC. You have advantage on this roll against humanoid creatures, and disadvantage against constructs and elementals.<br><br>
If you succeed, you can use your Sneak Attack against that target even if you don't have advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have disadvantage on it.<br><br>
This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until you successfully use this feature against a different target.
<h2>Field Care</h2>
Starting at 9th level, during a short rest, you can clean and bind the wounds of up to six willing beasts and humanoids. If a creature you choose spends a Hit Die during this rest, the first hit die it expends is replaced by the maximum value of that die.
<h2>Medical Prodigy</h2>
Beginning at 13th level, you've incorporated a wider range of solutions to cures, to the point where your ability to cure patients borders on supernatural. You can make a Wisdom (Medicine) check on a creature within 5 feet to cure it of blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned conditions.<br><br>
If the condition was the result of failing a saving throw, the DC of the check is equal to the DC of the saving throw. Otherwise the DC is 10.
<h2>Anatomical Expertise</h2>
When you reach 17th level, when you attack a target that you have succeeded on an Anatomical Assessment of, you can use that knowledge of their weakness to identify where stabbing them would do the most damage.<br><br>
When you hit with a melee weapon attack against the target, you can inflict one of the following conditions:
<ul>
<li><strong>Hamstring.</strong> You cripple the creature's locomotion, reducing its movement speed by half.</li>
<li><strong>Artery.</strong> You open a critical artery, causing it to take 4d4 piercing damage at the start of its turns.</li>
<li><strong>Larynx.</strong> You attack the creature's vocal apparatus. The target is muted and cannot speak.</li>
<li><strong>Eyes.</strong> You strike the creature's eyes. The target is blinded.</li>
</ul>
At the end of a crippled creatures turns, it makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus), ending the condition on a success. Once a creature has saved against a wound type, they are immune to that wound type for 24 hours.<br><br>
You can do this a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and you regain expended all uses when you complete a long rest.
