        <h1>Raven's Shadow Archetype</h1>
        You have taken an oath much like the ones taken by the paladins. One deity or another now sponsors your oath and has chosen to forgive you for your past sins. In return you are now bound to the role of holy assassin, dedicated to destroying those things that are most evil.<br><br>
With your already remarkable skills, you are given a small piece of divine power that allows you to smite the unwary vampire, or the ambitious lich with radiant power.
<h2>Oath Bound Assassin</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, when you choose this archetype, you gain proficiency in religion and arcana.<br><br>
In addition, you are blessed with greater sight with which to hunt your prey. You can see normally in darkness, both magical and non magical, to a distance of 120 feet.
<h2>Mark of the Raven</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can mark a creature within 60 feet of you as a bonus action. While the creature is marked, you gain the following benefits against them until they die, or you are incapacitated.
<ul>
<li>You don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack.</li>
<li>Any attack roll you make against the marked target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.</li>
<li>You can choose to have your sneak attack damage be dealt as radiant damage to that target.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Divine Senses</h2>
Starting at 9th level, you attain the gifts necessary to stalk evil into the darkest of dens. You can cast <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=201">Detect Evil and Good</a> without expending a spell slot.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Enshadowed Mind</h2>
Starting at 13th level, your mind becomes an impenetrable darkness. You gain advantage on any saving throw you would make against divination or enchantment magics. Additionally, you can no longer be frightened or charmed.
<h2>Banishing Backstab</h2>
At 17th level, when you deal sneak attack damage to a creature, you can force them to make a Charisma saving throw with a DC of 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency modifier. On a failed save, the creature is magically banished to a harmless demi-plane for one minute. On a successful save, the creature can't be banished by this feature for 24 hours.<br><br>
You must concentrate on this banishment as you would concentrate on a spell. If you lose concentration, or if the minute passes, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.<br><br>
Once you successfully use this feature on a creature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
