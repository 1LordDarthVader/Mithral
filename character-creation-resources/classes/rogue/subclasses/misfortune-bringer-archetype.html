<h1>Misfortune Bringer Archetype</h1>

You've matched your penchant for illicit activities with the ability to mark your enemies for mishaps and misfortune. Whether your mother was a hag, you were imbued with magical powers by spending time among the fey, or you learned the art of cursing from a long line of hedge wizards before you, you are a Misfortune Bringer. Although not universal, many Misfortune Bringers have eyes of two different colors, using only one when glaring at the targets they intend to curse.

<h2>Evil Eye</h2>
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to place a minor curse on others with a glance. As a bonus action on your turn, choose a creature you can see within 60 feet. The chosen creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your misfortune save DC or be marked by your evil eye. While a creature is marked by your evil eye, you can use your Sneak Attack against the creature even if you don't have advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have disadvantage on it.

<br><br>The creature remains marked by your evil eye for 1 minute or until you mark a different creature with your evil eye, whichever comes first.

<h2>Misfortunist</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you learn misfortunes that you can inflict on those marked by your evil eye.

<h3>Misfortunes</h3>
You learn two misfortunes of your choice, which are detailed under “Misfortunes” below. You learn an additional misfortune of your choice at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Each time you finish a long rest, you can replace one misfortune you know with a different one.

<h3>Jinx Points</h3>
You have four jinx points. When you spend a jinx point, it is no longer available to you until you regain it. You regain all spent jinx points when you finish a short or long rest.

<br><br>You gain two additional jinx points at 13th level.

<h3>Saving Throws</h3>
Your evil eye, and some of your misfortunes, require your target to make a saving throw to resist their effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

<br><br><strong>Misfortune save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

<h2>Steal Luck</h2>
Starting at 9th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw with advantage, you can use your reaction to remove advantage from the roll. When you do, you regain an expended jinx point. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.

<h2>Curse Caster</h2>
At 13th level, you can use an action and spend 3 jinx points to cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=75">Bestow Curse</a> spell. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

<h2>Improved Steal Luck</h2>
At 17th level, you can use the Steal Luck feature three times, regaining all uses when you finish a short or long rest.

<h2>Misfortunes</h2>

<h3>Curse of the Befuddled</h3>
As an action you can spend 2 jinx points, and the creature marked by your evil eye is charmed for 10 minutes. When you do, the creature is no longer marked by your evil eye, and the charmed condition ends early if you or your allies deal damage to the creature or cause it to make a saving throw. After the 10 minutes have elapsed, the creature knows you used magic to influence its mood and disposition towards you.

<h3>Curse of the Clumsy</h3>
When a creature marked by your evil eye moves 5 feet or more, you can use your reaction and spend 3 jinx points to cause the creature to fall prone and have its movement speed reduced to 0 until the end of the turn. When you do, the creature is no longer marked by your evil eye.

<h3>Curse of the Debilitated</h3>
When a creature marked by your evil eye takes damage, you can use your reaction and spend 1 jinx point to roll 1d12. The creature takes necrotic damage equal to the result.

<h3>Curse of the Doomed</h3>
After you miss with a weapon attack against a creature marked by your evil eye, you can use your reaction and spend 1 jinx point to make an additional weapon attack against the creature as part of the same action.

<h3>Curse of the Fearful</h3>
As an action you can spend 2 jinx points, and the creature marked by your evil eye is frightened for 1 minute. When you do, the creature is no longer marked by your evil eye, and it can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this misfortune early on a success.

<h3>Curse of the Inept</h3>
After a creature marked by your evil eye makes an ability check or attack roll, but before the DM declares whether or not it is successful, you can use your reaction and spend 1 jinx point to make the creature reroll and use the lower result.

<h3>Curse of the Insensate</h3>
As an action you can spend 3 jinx points, and the creature marked by your ev eye is blinded and deafened for 1 minute. When you do, the creature is no longer marked by your evil eye, and it can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this misfortune early on a success.

<h3>Curse of the Maimed</h3>
When you hit a creature marked by your evil eye with a weapon attack, and the die result was 18 or 19, you can use your reaction and spend 2 jinx points to turn the hit into a critical.

<h3>Curse of the Marked</h3>
As a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 2 jinx points to enhance the effects of your evil eye on a creature you have marked by it. When you do, the duration increases to 24 hours or until you mark a different creature with your evil eye, whichever comes first. Additionally, while the creature is marked by your evil eye, you always know the direction and distance to the creature, provided you are on the same plane.

<h3>Curse of the Plagued</h3>
When a creature marked by your evil eye regains hit points, you can use your reaction and spend 1 jinx point to halve the amount of hit points regained. When you do, the creature can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

<h3>Curse of the Ruined</h3>
After a creature marked by your evil eye makes a saving throw, but before the DM declares whether or not it is successful, you can use your reaction and spend 2 jinx points to make the creature reroll and use the lower result.

<h3>Curse of the Somnolent</h3>
As an action, you can spend 3 jinx points, and the creature marked by your evil eye becomes drowsy. Roll a number of d10 equal to your level in this class and add 15 to their total. If the creature's current hit points are equal to or less than the total, it goes unconscious. The target regains consciousness after 10 minutes, or when it takes damage or another creature uses its action to rouse it.

<h3>Curse of the Unlucky</h3>
As a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 3 jinx points to put a pox on a creature marked by your evil eye. Whenever the creature makes an attack roll or saving throw, you roll 1d4 and subtract the result from their total. This pox ends when the creature is no longer marked by your evil eye.
