        <h1>Dreadskull Archetype</h1>
        Dreadskull's are often individuals how have form a symbiotic relationship with an angry spirit. The spirit uses the host to complete some task while the host gains a suite of horrifying powers. They appear like normal mortals, made of flesh and bone; But in an instant they can transform into a nightmarish creature that strikes fear into the hearts of the strongest of minds.
<h2>Dreadful Form</h2>
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you are still technically alive, but at anytime you may summon the dark spirit you made a pact with and take on the visage. As a bonus action, you may enter a dread form. While in this form you gain resistance to necrotic, and cold damage, and you don't need air to breath. Additionally, whenever you you make a Charisma (Intimidation) check to cause fear, or intimidate information out of a creature, treat a roll of 7 or lower on the d20 as an 8.<br><br>
Dreadform lasts for one minute. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Gaze of Terror</h2>
At 3rd level, your eyes, dread form or not, strike mortal fear in your enemies. As a bonus action, you can force a creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, they are frightened of you for 1 minute or until you use this feature again, and you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against the creature. The creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
<h2>Ethereal Stalker</h2>
At 9th level, no fortress can keep you out. While in your dread form, you may spend a bonus action to treat solid objects and walls as difficult terrain until the end of your turn. You must end your movement in an open space, otherwise you take 1d10 force damage and are pushed out to the closest available space.<br><br>
You may use this feature a number of times equal to your charisma modifier and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Brutal Flourish</h2>
At 13th level, the fear of death others feel is what make you so dangerous. You can now turn that into a weapon of your own. Whenever you drop a creature that is frightened of you to zero hit points with a weapon attack, you can roll sneak attack damage and deal half as much to another creature within 60 ft that can see you. You can then use your gaze of terror feature on that creature.(No Action Required)
<h2>Fear Itself</h2>
At 17th level, you've gained the ability to sow doubt in the fearless. Your gaze of terror now ignores immunity to being frightened, unless the creature is a construct, and whenever you deal sneak attack damage to a creature that is frightened of you, you deal an extra 3d6 psychic damage.
