        <h1>Divine Agent Archetype</h1>
        Not all priests are clerics. Not all problems can be solved by prayer and preaching. Sometimes a more subtle touch is needed to steer the world as the faith dictates, and that is the roll of a Divine Agent. A blade in the night that commits the lesser evil for the greater good, or a quick end to someone that sniffed too close a cult's business, both could be the work of these divinely guided rogues.

<h2>Spellcasting</h2>
When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the /cleric-spell-list">cleric spell list.
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
        You learn three cantrips: <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=369">Guidance</a> and two other cantrips of your choice from the <a href="../../../spells/classes/cleric.html">cleric spell list</a>. At 10th level you learn another cantrip from the cleric spell list.
<h3>Spell Slots</h3>
The Divine Agent Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
<h3>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</h3>
You know three 1st-level cleric spells of your choice. The Spells Known column of the Divine Agent Spellcasting table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or divination spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.<br><br>
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the cleric spells you know with another spell of your choice from the cleric spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or divination spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells.
<br><br>
        <strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier<br />
<strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier
<h2>Consecration</h2>
Beginning at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Religion skill and your proficiency bonus is doubled for Intelligence (Religion) checks. When you use holy water as a weapon, it counts as a ranged weapon you have proficiency with.
<h2>Benediction</h2>
Starting at 9th, you gain the ability to cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=51">Augury</a> and <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=111">Ceremony</a> spells, but only as rituals. If you also learn these spells using your spellcasting feature, you can expend a spell slot to cast them as normal.
<h2>Sanctification</h2>
At 13th level, when you deal damage with your Sneak Attack, you can choose to deal the extra damage as Radiant damage.<br><br>
Additionally, if you have dealt radiant damage to a creature within the last minute, you have advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to detect it or see though its illusions, and you can see the creature even if it is invisible or in magical darkness.
<h2>Purification</h2>
Starting at 17th level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to grasp your holy symbol and burn away any evil affliction. When you do this, you take 1d12 fire damage that cannot be resisted in any way, but gain an equal number of temporary hit points and end the effect of a curse, disease, or magical effect on yourself.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.
