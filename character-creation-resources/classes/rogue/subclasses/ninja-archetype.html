        <h1>Ninja Archetype</h1>
        Lurking in high mountaintop temples, darting amongst forest foliage, or haunting abandoned streets, a ninja is an elite rogue who has undergone intense training focused on stealth, infiltration, and survival. Some ninjas hire out their skills as mercenaries, but most owe fealty to a clan, and wander the world under specific directives from their leaders.
<h2>Ki</h2>
When you adopt this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. You have a number of ki points equal to half your rogue level, rounded down, which you can use to fuel special techniques. This pool of ki points is cumulative and adds together with any other ki points from other classes or features.<br><br>
When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.
<h2>Ninjutsu</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you learn the arts of the ninja. You can use your Cunning Action to make an unarmed strike. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 damage and you can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls. Furthermore, you can make Sneak Attacks using unarmed strikes in addition to finesse and ranged weapons as long as you meet the other requirements of that feature. You also gain the following Ki abilities:
<ul>
<li><strong>Distract.</strong> Once on each of your turns, you can spend 1 ki point to distract a creature you can see within 5 feet of you. You have advantage on your next attack roll you make against this creature before the end of your turn.</li>
<li><strong>Smoke Bomb.</strong> As an action, you can expend 1 ki point to cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=303">Fog Cloud</a> spell.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Immaculate Footwork</h2>
At 9th level, you are supernaturally fast and precise in your movements. When you use the Dash action on your turn, you may expend 1 ki point to increase the movement it provides by 15 feet. For the duration of the turn you may move up, down, and across vertical surfaces without requiring an ability check, and also treat the surface of any fluid as if it were solid for the purposes of movement. Choppy water or similar may be treated as difficult terrain, and fluids that would cause damage (such as acid or lava) will still cause damage on contact.<br><br>
If you end your movement while standing on a vertical surface or fluid you cannot normally stand on, you begin falling or sinking at the start of your next turn unless you immediately take the Dash action and expend ki on this ability again at the start of that turn, and move at least 10 feet during the turn.
<h2>Rooftop Perch</h2>
At 13th level, you travel the heights of the world without fear. You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to balance on any footing, and you can attempt to Hide from creatures more than 10 feet below you even if you are not otherwise in cover. You have advantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks when you attempt to Hide in this way.<br><br>
Additionally, you can use an action and spend 2 ki points to magically become invisible for up to 1 minute. The condition ends early if you attack or cast a spell.
<h2>Shadow Warrior</h2>
When you reach 17th level, you are almost impossible to detect, even in the middle of combat. If you take an action that would normally cause you to stop being invisible or be revealed from hiding, you can spend 1 ki point to maintain your invisibility or remain hidden.
