        <h1>Acrobat Archetype</h1>
        Trained by circuses, certain temples, and the odd organization of criminals (or vigilantes), the archetypical Acrobat is light on their feet and incredibly agile, able to tumble, somersault, and walk across tightropes with ease. The skills of a gymnast find a myriad of applications in the adventuring world, so whether it be for dungeon diving, cat-burgling, or brawling in a busy tavern, acrobats are always great to have on your side.
<h2>Natural Acrobat</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you have proficiency in the Dexterity (Acrobatics) skill if you did not already have it, and you have advantage on ability checks made using this skill on your turn. Additionally, when you are prone, standing up uses only 5 feet of your movement.
<h2>Advanced Tumbling</h2>
At 3rd level, you can move through the space of any creature without it costing extra movement. Once you have moved through a creature's space, that creature has disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you until the end of your turn.
<h2>Death from Above</h2>
At 9th level, you have resistance to damage from falls. If you land on a creature's space at the end of a fall and take the Attack action, you have advantage on your attack roll and you deal an additional 1d6 damage for every 10 feet you fell, up to a maximum of 5d6. Only melee weapon attacks can benefit from this feature.
<h2>Freerunning</h2>
Starting at 13th level, you ignore difficult terrain and climbing no longer halves your movement. You can spend up to half your movement speed on your turn climbing even difficult surfaces (such as vertical walls) without making an ability check.
<h2>Peerless Dodge</h2>
By 17th level, you are so nimble you can use your reaction to take no falling damage from falling any distance shorter than 100 feet. Additionally, you can dodge almost anything. When a creature you can see damages you with a spell, you can use your Uncanny Dodge to halve the spell's damage against you.
