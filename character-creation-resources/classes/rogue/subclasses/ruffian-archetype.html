        <h1>Ruffian Archetype</h1>
        You've learned to fight dirty whenever you can, and that villainy—for better or worse—can open more doors than it closes. Yours is a walk of life shared by Thieves' Guild enforcers, untrained brawlers, highwaymen, and crooked mercenaries. Quick thinking, versatility in action, and utter ruthlessness help you to shine in a skirmish, as well as corral strangers in the social world.
<h2>Quick-Witted Crook</h2>
Starting when you select this archetype at 3rd level, your wherewithal leaves you ever-ready for trouble. You can't be surprised while conscious, and gain proficiency with improvised weapons. In addition, clubs, light hammers, maces, sickles, and improvised weapons become finesse weapons for you.
<h2>Dirty Fighting</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you double down on scrappiness. Whenever you land a Sneak Attack on a creature within 5 feet of you, you can activate a Dirty Tactic before rolling for damage. To do so, you must forgo rolling a certain number of your Sneak Attack dice (based on the Dirty Tactic chosen), after which any remaining d6s are rolled for damage.<br><br>
When you activate a Dirty Tactic, you must execute it on the target of your Sneak Attack and you cannot use more than 1 Dirty Tactic per attack. You can only use Dirty Tactics with costs that don't exceed the number of d6s you'd normally roll for a Sneak Attack. For example, at 3rd and 4th level, you can only use Dirty Tactics which cost 2d6 or less.<br><br>
If you wish to use a Dirty Tactic when you score a critical hit, double the amount of Sneak Attack dice to be rolled for damage first. Then, subtract the Dirty Tactic's d6 cost from this total.<br><br>
Your Dirty Tactics may force a creature to make a saving throw. If so, the DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity or Strength modifier (whichever is higher).
<h2>Bully</h2>
At 9th level, you develop a flair for exploiting the panicked. You can now use your Sneak Attack against frightened creatures without having advantage on your attack rolls. Using your Cunning Action, you can make a Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by the Wisdom (Insight) check of a creature within 30 feet of you. On a success, that creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn or until you and the target are more than 30 feet apart.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain any expended uses each time you finish a long rest.
<h2>Fool Me Once</h2>
From 13th level, you more quickly adapt to strategies you didn't initially outsmart. After failing a saving throw caused by a creature, you have advantage on the next saving throw that uses the same ability score caused by that creature. You cannot benefit from this feature against the same creature more than once per short or long rest.
<h2>Expert Miscreant</h2>
By 17th level, you have mastered every dirty trick in the book. If a creature succeeds on its saving throw against one of your Dirty Tactics, you can recover the d6s you spent to activate it. When you do so, you can use another Dirty Tactic as part of the same action or reaction, or roll the d6s for Sneak Attack damage.<br><br>
You have two uses of this feature, and you regain any expended uses when you roll for initiative.

        <h2>Dirty Tactics</h2>
The dirty are presented in order of sneak attack dice cost.
<br><br>
        <strong>Throat Slam (costs 1d6).</strong> You attempt to crush a creature’s windpipe, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, until the start of your next turn, the target’s next saving throw to maintain concentration is made with disadvantage, and it can only speak falteringly.
<br><br>
        <strong>Vicious Wound (costs 1d6).</strong> You forgo a direct assault and try to cause a creature greater long-term harm, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, the creature suffers an <a href="../../../../house-rules/injuries.html">injury</a> in addition to the damage of the attack.
<br><br>
        <strong>Cheap Shot (costs 2d6).</strong> You attempt to hit a creature with a cheap shot, forcing it to succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have its movement speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. During this time, the target cannot use the Dash, Dodge, Help, Search, Ready or Use an Object actions, nor can it take reactions.
<br><br>
        <strong>Outrageous Insult (costs 3d6).</strong> You attempt to draw a creature’s ire by infuriating it, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on its attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.
<br><br>
        <strong>Kneecrack (costs 4d6).</strong> You attempt to lame a creature that is Large or smaller, forcing it to succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone.
<br><br>
        <strong>Maim (costs 5d6).</strong> You attempt to cripple a creature, forcing it to succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop whatever it's holding in an appendage of your choice. The target cannot use that appendage in any way until the end of its next turn.
<br><br>
        <strong>Eye Gouge (costs 6d6).</strong> You attempt to curtail a creature’s vision by any means necessary, forcing it to succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the start of your next turn.
