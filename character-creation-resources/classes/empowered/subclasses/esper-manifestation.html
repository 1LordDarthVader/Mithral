<h1>Esper Manifestation</h1>

The mind is a dangerous thing. Your powers have enhanced your brain as much as your body, allowing you to exert powerful influence on those around you.

<h2>Psychokinesis</h2>
When you choose this manifestation at 3rd level, the power of your mind is unlocked. You can cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=481">Mage Hand</a> and <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=511">Message</a> cantrips without using components. Your mage hand is invisible when cast this way.

<br><br>Additionally, you can attempt to shove creatures at a distance if you can see them and they are unobstructed. When you do so successfully, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of your Pure Strength die if they are pushed into an obstacle or knocked prone.

<br><br>You can only attempt to shove creatures this way if their distance from you is less than or equal to your Kinetic Range, which is calculated as follows:

<br><br><strong>Kinetic Range =</strong> 5 feet + a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 10 feet total).

<h2>Intellect Radar</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you are passively aware of all sentient beings around you. Whenever you end your turn, you can use your reaction to send out a psychic pulse that tells you the location of any creature within your Kinetic Range with an Intelligence score that is lower than yours.

<br><br>This feature only tells you the location of creatures in the exact instant that you use it. Creatures within your Kinetic Range can tell when you use this feature if their passive perception is higher than your power save DC.

<h2>Force Field</h2>
At 7th level, whenever a creature you can see within your Kinetic Range starts their turn, you can use a reaction to force them to make a Strength saving throw against your power save DC. On a failed save, the creature's movement speed is halved until the start of their next turn and they take psychic damage equal to a roll of your Pure Strength die.

<h2>Kinetic Grip</h2>
Starting at 13th level, you can now freely exert your will over the world around you. You can cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=756">Telekinesis</a> spell at will, requiring no components, and your spellcasting ability for the spell is Intelligence. When you cast Telekinesis this way, you can target objects that aren't being worn or carried.

<h2>Cognitive Overdrive</h2>
At 17th level you can use a bonus action on your turn to release the full power of your intellect for a short time. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>Your Kinetic Range is doubled.</li>
    <li>You gain 30 feet of flying speed and can hover.</li>
    <li>Your Force Field reduces that target's movement speed to 0 until the start of their next turn on a failed save.</li>
</ul>

Your overdrive ends early if you are incapacitated, or if you use a bonus action on your turn to end it early. Once you use this feature, you must complete a long rest to use it again.
