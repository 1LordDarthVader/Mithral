        <h1>Hybrid Manifestation</h1>
        While druids serve the land voluntarily, nature has singled you out to be its champion. Your powers have turned you into something wild, untamed, and dangerous.
<h2>Nature's Chosen</h2>
When you choose this manifestation at 3rd level, your creature type changes to beast and your unarmed strikes can deal slashing damage. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
<h2>Feral Enhancements</h2>
Also at 3rd level, your body has transformed to have several animalistic traits, granting you the following features.
<ul>
<li><strong>Crawler.</strong> You can crawl while prone without expending extra movement. While prone, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</li>
<li><strong>Prehensile Tail.</strong> You grow a 10 foot long tail you can use to grab objects or attempt to grapple or shove creatures. If your race already has a tail, you can either keep your existing tail or alter your existing tail's appearance.</li>
<li><strong>Saber Tooth.</strong> Whenever you attempt to grapple a creature within 5 feet of you, you can choose to do so using your fangs. If this grapple is successful, the creature takes piercing damage equal to your Strength modifier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pounce</h2>
At 7th level, whenever you land on or impact a creature as part of a long or high jump, you can immediately attempt to grapple the creature as part of the jump. If this grapple succeeds, the creature is knocked prone as well. Additionally, you can make long and high jumps while you are prone.
<h2>Apex Predator</h2>
Starting at 13th level, you've adapted to your animal form quite well. You gain the following improvements for your Feral Enhancements.
<ul>
<li><strong>Crawler.</strong> You no longer gain disadvantage on attack rolls due to being prone, and creatures on longer gain advantage on attack rolls against you due to being within 5 feet of you while you are prone.</li>
<li><strong>Prehensile Tail.</strong> Your tail can now be used to make unarmed strikes using Pure Strength against creatures within 10 feet of you.</li>
<li><strong>Saber Tooth.</strong> While you are grappling a creature with your fangs, you automatically succeed on attempts to shove them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Venom</h2>
At 17th level, you can inject a powerful venom into your foes. While you are grappling a creature with your fangs or your tail, you can expend a use of Strength Surge as an action to force them to make a Constitution saving throw against your power save DC. The creature takes 4d12 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Also on a failed save, the creature becomes poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, the creature can reattempt the saving throw for this feature at the end of each of its turns, ending their poisoned condition on a successful save.
