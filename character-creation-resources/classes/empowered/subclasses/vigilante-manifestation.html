<h1>Vigilante Manifestation</h1>
In the dead of night, you give your enemies something to be scared of. You don't fight fair, and you might not even fight for what's right. All that matters to you is enacting your own sense of justice. To that end, you work in the dark.
<h2>Prowler</h2>
When you choose this manifestation at 3rd level, you do your best work when you stick to the shadows and stalk your foes. While you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you gain the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>You can use a bonus action to take the Hide action during your turn.</li>
    <li>You have advantage on attempts to grapple creatures while you are hidden from them.</li>
    <li>You can grapple creatures without making any noise, and you can prevent creatures you are grappling from making any noise that would alert others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chokehold</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you are not very fond of letting your prey escape once you catch them. Whenever a creature attempts to break free from your grapple and fails, you can choose to tighten your grip on them, causing them to take bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of your Pure Strength die.
<h2>No Escape</h2>
At 7th level, you've had enough of your enemies trying to run. When a creature within 15 feet of you starts moving away from you on their turn, you can use a reaction to try to catch them. You can use half of your movement speed to go directly to the creature and attempt to grapple or shove them without provoking opportunity attacks.<br><br>
You can use any type of movement to get to the creature, but you must be able to sense the creature's presence and have a direct, unobstructed path to them to use this feature.
<h2>Ominous Stare</h2>
At 13th level, you can strike fear into the hearts of your foes. As an action on your turn, you can force a creature you can see to make a Wisdom saving throw against your power save DC. The creature must be within 60 feet of you and able to see you. On a failed save, the creature is frightened by you for the next minute Once you use this feature to successfully frighten a creature, you must complete a short or long rest before using it again.<br><br>
Additionally, you can use your Sucker Punch against creatures if they are frightened by you and you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll.
<h2>No Mercy</h2>
At 17th level, you are absolutely relentless. Once per turn when you successfully grapple or shove a creature, you can immediately target the creature with a single unarmed strike using Pure Strength as part of the grapple or shove.
