        <h1>Vigilante Manifestation</h1>
        In the dead of night, you give your enemies something to be scared of. You don't fight fair, and you might not even fight for what's right. All that matters to you is enacting your own sense of justice. To that end, you work in the dark.
<h2>Prowler</h2>
When you choose this manifestation at 3rd level, you prefer to stalk your foes. You can use your bonus action to take the Hide action on your turn. While you are hidden from a creature, you have advantage on attempts to grapple them, and can do so without you or the creature creating any noise that would alert others.<br><br>
Additionally, whenever you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, you can expend a use of Strength Surge to roll an additional d20. You can use this feature after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the check.
<h2>Sucker Punch</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you aren't above fighting dirty if need be. Once per turn, you can deal extra damage equal to a roll of your Pure Strength die to one creature you hit with an unarmed strike using Pure Strength if you have advantage on the attack roll.<br><br>
Provided that you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll, you do not need advantage on the attack roll to deal this damage if you are grappling the target, or if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, and that enemy is not incapacitated.
<h2>No Escape</h2>
At 7th level, you've had enough of your enemies trying to run. When a creature within 15 feet of you starts moving away from you on their turn, you can use a reaction to try to catch them. You can use half of your movement speed to go directly to the creature and attempt to grapple or shove them without provoking opportunity attacks.<br><br>
You can use any type of movement to get to the creature, but you must be able to sense the creature's presence and have a direct, unobstructed path to them to use this feature.
<h2>Ominous Stare</h2>
At 13th level, you can strike fear into the hearts of your foes. As an action on your turn, you can force a creature you can see to make a Wisdom saving throw against your power save DC. The creature must be within 60 feet of you and able to see you. On a failed save, the creature is frightened by you for the next minute Once you use this feature to successfully frighten a creature, you must complete a short or long rest before using it again.<br><br>
Additionally, you can use your Sucker Punch against creatures if they are frightened by you and you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll.
<h2>No Mercy</h2>
At 17th level, you are absolutely relentless. Once per turn when you successfully grapple or shove a creature, you can immediately target the creature with a single unarmed strike using Pure Strength as part of the grapple or shove.
