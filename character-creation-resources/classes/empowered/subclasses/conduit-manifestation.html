        <h1>Conduit Manifestation</h1>
        Your powers were formed after an encounter with a supernatural elemental event, making you a powerhouse of primordial energy. These powers are difficult to control, so be careful not to hurt those closest to you.
<h2>Elemental Infusion</h2>
When you choose this manifestation at 3rd level, you choose which damage type you're infused with: cold, fire, or lightning. Your chosen damage is referred to as your 'infusion damage.' You gain resistance to your infusion damage. Whenever you land an unarmed strike using Pure Strength, you can use infusion damage in place of the strike's normal damage type.
<h2>Energy Beam</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you can project a beam of vibrant and deadly energy. You can use the Attack action to attack with this beam, and it benefits from abilities like Extra Attack as normal. To fire the beam, make a ranged attack against a creature you can see within 100 feet of you using Constitution as the ability modifier for the attack. On a hit, this attack deals infusion damage equal to a roll of your Pure Strength die + your Constitution modifier.<br><br>
If you take damage of the same type as your Elemental Infusion, your Energy Beam becomes charged, causing it to deal extra damage equal to a roll of your Pure Strength die until the end of your next turn. As a bonus action on your turn, you can willingly deal infusion damage to yourself equal to a roll of your Pure Strength die. You cannot resist your infusion damage when you deal it to yourself this way.
<h2>Hazard Zone</h2>
By 7th level, getting close to you is dangerous. While your Energy Beam is charged, creatures take infusion damage equal to a roll of your Pure Strength die if they move within 5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or start their turn there.
<h2>Beam Sculpting</h2>
At 13th level, your Energy Beam can now be sculpted into different shapes. As an action on your turn, you can expend a use of Strength Surge to make a separate attack roll with your Energy Beam against each creature within one of the following areas of effect:
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy Blast.</strong> A 15 foot cone in front of you.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Volley.</strong> A 10 foot radius sphere located up to 100 feet away from you.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Ray.</strong> A line that is 100 feet long and 5 feet wide, projected out from you in any direction.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hyper Beam</h2>
At 17th level, as an action on your turn, you can unleash a Hyper Beam that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide, forcing all creatures within range to make a Dexterity saving throw against your power save DC. This saving throw is made with disadvantage if your Energy Beam is charged. Creatures take 12d8 infusion damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Once you unleash your Hyper Beam, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.
