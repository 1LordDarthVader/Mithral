        <h1>Idol Manifestation</h1>
        The Idol is a symbol that the people look to for hope and direction. They are usually everyday individuals who have had the responsibility of power thrust upon them. As such, their powers are simple and effective.
<h2>Everyman</h2>
When you choose this manifestation at 3rd level, you're a humble adventurer, of simple beginnings. You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.<br><br>
Additionally, you gain one of the following proficiencies:
<ul>
<li>Proficiency with a language of your choice.</li>
<li>Proficiency with a set of artisan's tools of your choice.</li>
<li>Proficiency with a weapon of your choice.</li>
<li>Proficiency with a skill of your choice.</li>
</ul>
You can choose an additional one of these proficiencies at 7th, 13th, and 17th level in this class, but you cannot choose the same trait twice.
<h2>Exemplar</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you lead by example. Once on per turn when you hit a hostile creature with an unarmed strike using Pure Strength, you can expend a use of Strength Surge to embolden an ally of your choice within 30 feet of you. The target must be able to either see or hear you.<br><br>
While a creature is emboldened, they can roll your Pure Strength die and add the number rolled to an attack or damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll your Pure Strength die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack. This reaction can be taken after seeing the attack roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.<br><br>
The creature ceases to be emboldened after rolling your Pure Strength die. You cannot use this ability on a creature that is currently emboldened.
<h2>Experimental Training</h2>
At 7th level, you learn an additional Astounding Power whose requirements you meet. This power does not count against your number of Powers Known. Additionally, you can now use your Strength Surge a number of times equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of twice).
<h2>Fearless Leader</h2>
At 13th level, so long as you keep fighting, your allies will stick by you through thick and thin. Whenever you use your Exemplar ability to embolden a creature, you become emboldened as well. Additionally, whenever you use your Exemplar ability to embolden a creature, that creature ceases to be charmed or frightened.
<h2>Glorious Purpose</h2>
At 17th level, your sense of purpose gives you the strength to face down your destiny. You can use a bonus action to regain a single use of Strength Surge. For one minute after using this ability, or until you are incapacitated, you regain a use of Strength Surge at the start of each of your turns. Once you use this ability, you must complete a long rest to use it again.
