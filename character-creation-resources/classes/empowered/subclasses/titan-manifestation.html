        <h1>Titan Manifestation</h1>
        Your power is so wild and vibrant that you often struggle to contain it. When this energy simmers over, you transform dramatically, unleashing your true strengt for a short time.
<h2>True Form</h2>
When you choose this manifestation at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to assume your True Form for 1 minute. You exit this form early if you use a bonus action to end it, or if you are charmed, frightened, or knocked unconscious. You gain the following benefits while in your True Form:
<ul>
<li>You become one size larger, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to grow, your physical size doesn't change but you are still considered one size larger.</li>
<li>When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you can make a Strength saving throw instead.</li>
<li>When you successfully shove a creature, they take bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier if they impact an obstacle or are knocked prone.</li>
</ul>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Living Weapon</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you gain the ability to hit one creature with another. While you are grappling a creature that is your size or smaller, you can use them to make an unarmed strike against another creature. If you hit the target creature, they take the unarmed strike's damage as normal, and the grappled creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of your Pure Strength die.
<h2>Crushing Grip</h2>
At 7th level, if you are grappling a creature, that creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of your Pure Strength die at the start of each of its turns.
<h2>Deafening Roar</h2>
By 13th level, you can expend a use of Strength Surge as a bonus action to let out an ear-splitting roar. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw against your power save DC. On a failed save, creatures are knocked prone and deafened until the end of your next turn.
<h2>Seismic Slam</h2>
At 17th level, if you are grappling a creature that is your size or smaller, you can use an action on your turn to repeatedly slam the creature into the ground in a fit of rage. When you use this ability, the grappled creature must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your power save DC, the target chooses the ability to use for the throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d10 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is stunned until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not stunned. You stop grappling the creature after using this ability. Once you use this ability, you must complete a long rest before using it again.
