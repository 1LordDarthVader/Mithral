        <h1>Mutant Manifestation</h1>
        You walk the line between what is natural and what is monstrous. Your physiology has been permanently altered, and now you have to live with what you are.
<h2>Bio-Weapon</h2>
When you choose this manifestation at 3rd level, your creature type changes to monstrosity, and you gain the ability to morph your limbs into weapons. As a bonus action, you can grants yourself one of the following benefits:
<ul>
<li><strong>Bio-Sword.</strong> Your unarmed strike deals slashing damage. Once per turn when you roll damage for an unarmed strike using Pure Strength, you can reroll the strike's damage dice and use either total.</li>
<li><strong>Bio-Whip.</strong> Your unarmed strike deals slashing damage and has the reach property. Using this Bio-Weapon increases your movement speed by 10 feet.</li>
<li><strong>Bio-Shield.</strong> One of your forearms grows into a barrier that grants you +2 AC.</li>
</ul>
You retain the chosen benefit until you use a bonus action to either choose a new benefit or return your body to its normal shape.
<h2>Chameleon</h2>
Also at 3rd level, if you touch a humanoid creature that has died within the last minute, you can absorb a fragment of their identity. You learn the creature's name, age, occupation, and alignment. Once you have absorbed a creature's identity, you can cast Disguise Self at will to assume their form. While disguised as them, you perfectly imitate their voice.
<h2>Monstrous Imitation</h2>
At 7th level, while grappling a hostile creature, you can use your action to adopt some of their physical properties. For 1 hour, you gain any unique senses or resistances that the creature has. This does not work for senses or resistances granted by items. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
<h2>Facsimile</h2>
At 13th level, your shapeshifting abilities are fine-tuned. As an action on your turn, you can expend a use of Strength Surge to assume the shape of an inanimate object you have seen that weighs no more than 100 pounds and takes up no more space than a 5 foot cube. You can maintain this shape for up to 10 minutes while you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell).<br><br>
You cannot move or take normal actions while shapeshifted. The only action you can take is to return to your normal form. You assume the shape of the object, but not its texture or temperature. If a creature accidentally touches you while you are morphed, you can use a reaction to return to your normal form and grapple them instantly.
<h2>Dual Bio-Weapons</h2>
At 17th level, you can now manifest two different Bio-Weapons at once. Whenever you use a bonus action to manifest a Bio-Weapon, you can choose 2 different properties to grant your unarmed strike instead of 1.
