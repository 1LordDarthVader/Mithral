        <h1>Super Soldier Manifestation</h1>
        You discovered your powers during a time of strife, and carried them with you into battle. Learning how to wield your powers and a weapon at the same time wasn't easy. Now that you're acquainted with both, your training shines through.
<h2>Battle Ready</h2>
When you choose this manifestation at 3rd level, your wartime training allows you to combine combat expertise with sheer might. You gain the following benefits.
<ul>
<li><strong>Weapons of War.</strong> Choose two types of weapons to be your weapons of war. Each of these weapons can be any weapon with which you are proficient, as well as any simple or martial weapon that lacks the special property. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have them, and you can benefit from your Pure Strength while you are wielding them. If an empowered ability applies to unarmed strikes you make using Pure Strength, it also applies to attacks you make using a weapon of war. You can choose an additional weapon of war when you reach 7th, 13th, and 17th level in this class.</li>
<li><strong>Parrying Stance.</strong> You can wield any melee weapon of war with two hands, and you gain +1 AC while doing so.</li>
<li><strong>Power Shot.</strong> You can use Strength instead of Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls of your attacks with ranged weapons of war.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Guardian of Steel</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you can wear a full suit of armor and still wield the full might of your powers. You gain proficiency with heavy armor. While you are wearing heavy armor, you can gain the benefits of your Pure Strength, and you count as three-quarters cover for creatures that are not hostile to you.
<h2>Shield of War</h2>
At 7th level, you know that the best offense is a good defense. You gain proficiency with shields, can don or doff shields with the Use an Object action, and can gain the benefits of your Pure Strength while wielding a shield. You can also use shields to make unarmed strikes using Pure Strength.<br><br>
Additionally, you can treat shields as if they had the thrown property, with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. On a successful thrown hit, your shield will bounce off of the target and return to your hand. This thrown attack counts as an unarmed strike using Pure Strength for you.<br><br>
Finally, while you are wearing heavy armor and wielding a shield, you count as full cover for creatures that are not hostile to you.
<h2>Soldier On</h2>
At 13th level, you can summon up the strength to keep on fighting. Whenever you receive healing from others, you can add a roll of your Pure Strength die to the number of hit points restored. You automatically regain hit points equal to a roll of your Pure Strength die whenever you take a short rest.
<h2>Offensive Parry</h2>
At 17th level, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you targets you with a melee attack, you can use a reaction to target them with a melee attack with a weapon of war in response. If your attack hits, the creature's attack misses.
