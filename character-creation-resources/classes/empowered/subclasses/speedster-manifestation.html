        <h1>Speedster Manifestation</h1>
        You're fast. Very fast. You might be infused with the power of light, or favored by a god of speed. Either way, you leave everyone else in the dust.
<h2>Super Speed</h2>
When you choose this manifestation at 3rd level, your powers grant you supernatural speed. Once at the start of each of your turns, you can expend a use of Strength Surge to activate your Super Speed, which doubles any movement you gain by Dashing until the start of your next turn.<br><br>
Additionally you can move through spaces occupied by creatures while under the effects of your Super Speed. If you end your turn on an occupied space, you are forced into the nearest unoccupied space. Moving through a creature's space this way disorients them, which imposes disadvantage on the next attack roll or ability check the creature makes before the start of your next turn.
<h2>Athleticism</h2>
Also at 3rd level, even without your super speed, you're still pretty quick. You can take the Dash or Disengage actions as a bonus action on your turn.<br><br>
Additionally, your walking speed is increased by 5 feet. This bonus increases to 10 at 7th level in this class, to 15 at 13th level in this class, and to 20 at 17th level in this class.
<h2>Untouchable</h2>
Starting at 7th level, even while you are standing in place, it's hard to pin you down. You can begin concentrating on this ability as a bonus action on your turn (as if concentrating on a spell). For up to 1 minute while you maintain concentration, you do not provoke opportunity attacks, and attack rolls against you are made with disadvantage. Once you use this ability, you must complete a short or long rest to use it again.
<h2>Pure Agility</h2>
At 13th level, your unbridled speed allows you to traverse any area with ease. While under the effects of your Super Speed, you ignore the effects of difficult terrain, and you cannot be paralyzed, restrained, or otherwise have your speed reduced by spells or magical effects.<br><br>
Additionally, whenever you disorient a creature with your Super Speed, you can force the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw against your power save DC if they are no more than one size larger than you. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
<h2>Time in a Bottle</h2>
At 17th level, you can summon all of your energy to move faster than light. You can cast <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=780">Time Stop</a> as an action on your turn. When you cast Time Stop this way, you can grapple or shove creatures without resuming time, and your attempts to do either succeed automatically. Moving a creature you are grappling also does not resume time.<br><br>
Creatures that you shove while time is stopped will only begin to move once time resumes. If a creature is knocked prone or pushed into an obstacle once time resumes, they take 3d10 bludgeoning damage. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.
