<h1>Astounding Powers</h1>

<h2 id="toc0"><span>2nd-Level Powers</span></h2>
<h3 id="toc1"><span>Aftershock</span></h3>
<p>You can cast <a href="../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=776">Thunderwave</a> by striking the ground at your feet, using Strength as your spellcasting ability, and without using verbal components. The spell's level equals your proficiency bonus. Once you use this power, you must complete a long rest before using it again. In addition, nonmagical, unprotected flames within the spell's area of effect are put out.</p>
<h3 id="toc2"><span>Anatomical Armor</span></h3>
<p>While you are not wearing armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use your Anatomical Armor to determine your AC if the armor you are wearing would leave you with less AC.</p>
<h3 id="toc3"><span>Arcane Synesthesia</span></h3>
<p>You can cast <a href="../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=203">Detect Magic</a> at will, without using components.</p>
<h3 id="toc4"><span>Barehanded Block</span></h3>
<p>If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you are unarmed, unarmored, and are not wielding a shield, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.</p>
<h3 id="toc5"><span>Boring Monologue</span></h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 12 Charisma</em><br>
You can cast <a href="../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=117">Charm Person</a> as a 1st level spell, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. Rather than viewing you as a friendly acquaintance on a failed save, the target will admit that they are swayed by your reasonable line of thinking. Once you use this power, you must complete a short or long rest to use it again.</p>
<h3 id="toc6"><span>Collateral Damage</span></h3>
<p>You are proficient in the use of improvised weapons, and you can make use of your Pure Strength feature while wielding an improvised weapon.</p>
<h3 id="toc7"><span>Courage</span></h3>
<p>You regain a use of Strength Surge when you score a critical hit with an unarmed strike using Pure Strength against a conscious creature that is at least medium in size.</p>
<h3 id="toc8"><span>Destiny</span></h3>
<p>You can cast <a href="../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=51">Augury</a> without using material components or expending spell slots. Once you use this power, you must complete a long rest to do so again.</p>
<h3 id="toc9"><span>Daredevil</span></h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 12 Wisdom</em><br>
You gain 15 feet of Tremorsense, and 5 feet of Blindsight.</p>
<h3 id="toc10"><span>Fan Club</span></h3>
<p>Whenever you interact with a non-hostile NPC for the first time, the DM must roll a d20. On a roll of 20, the NPC recognizes you and is a fan of your exploits, and you have advantage on all Charisma checks against them until they have a reason to dislike you.</p>
<p>Members of your Fan Club cannot recognize you while you are using your Secret Identity. However, they can still recognize you even if you have the Nameless power, as they have been theorizing that your death was a hoax.</p>
<h3 id="toc11"><span>Harrowing Vision</span></h3>
<p>You can see normally in darkness, both magical and non magical, to a distance of 120 feet.</p>
<h3 id="toc12"><span>Immortal Spirit</span></h3>
<p>When you dream or meditate, you can access the memories of empowered beings that came before you. The DM rolls a d20 to determine the quality of the visions you receive, ranging from vague symbolism on a roll of 1, to crucial information on a roll of 20. At the DM's discretion, you might receive visions from one empowered being in particular, and that being might even speak to you directly.</p>
<h3 id="toc13"><span>Keen Vision</span></h3>
<p>With clear visibility, you can make out details of extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.</p>
<h3 id="toc14"><span>Minor Mentalist</span></h3>
<p>You can cast the <a href="../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=481">Mage Hand</a> and <a href="../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=511">Message</a> cantrips without using components. Your mage hand is invisible.</p>
<h3 id="toc15"><span>Momentus Tackle</span></h3>
<p>When you use a bonus action to attempt to grapple or shove a creature, you have an additional 10 feet of movement that you can use exclusively to get close enough to your desired target.</p>
<h3 id="toc16"><span>Nameless</span></h3>
<p>When you gain this power, you toss your old identity aside, allowing you to choose a new name and alignment. The old you is presumed dead by those who are not adventuring with you, and you won't be hunted down for crimes the old you committed. If a creature that used to know you discovers that you are not dead, they become stunned until the end of your next turn. You revert to your old identity permanently if you swap this power out for a new one.</p>
<h3 id="toc17"><span>Persona</span></h3>
<p>You gain one of the following personas of your choice:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detective.</strong> You gain proficiency in the Investigation and Perception skills.</li>
<li><strong>Dramatic.</strong> You can cast the <a href="../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=765">Thaumaturgy</a> cantrip, and gain proficiency in Performance.</li>
<li><strong>Heroic.</strong> You gain proficiency in the Insight and Persuasion skills.</li>
<li><strong>Mysterious.</strong> You gain proficiency in the Stealth and Survival skills.</li>
<li><strong>Villainous.</strong> You gain proficiency in the Deception and Intimidation skills.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="toc18"><span>Plot Armor</span></h3>
<p>When you roll a 1 on a d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Once you use this power, you must complete a short or long rest to use it again.</p>
<h3 id="toc19"><span>Pure of Heart</span></h3>
<p>You are immune to the charmed condition.</p>
<h3 id="toc20"><span>Quipping Expertise</span></h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 12 Charisma</em><br>
You can cast <a href="../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=813">Vicious Mockery</a>, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. When a creature fails the saving throw you impose with this spell, it has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.</p>
<h3 id="toc21"><span>Rending Strength</span></h3>
<p>You can expend a use of Strength Surge as an action to crush, bend, or break an inanimate object within your reach that is made of non-magical materials and is not being worn or carried. For larger objects, the area of the object that is bent, broken, or crushed is no larger than a 3-foot cube.</p>
<h3 id="toc22"><span>Secret Identity</span></h3>
<p>You have an alter ego: a more mundane identity that you use outside of your adventuring life. Your alter ego has a separate name, home, occupation, and perhaps even a family or a place amongst high society. You can adopt this alternate identity as a disguise, and other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.</p>
<p>Inexplicably, you can don or doff your alter ego in the blink of an eye, but only when no one is watching.</p>
<h3 id="toc23"><span>Sidekick</span></h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 12 Charisma</em><br>
As an action, you can designate one friendly creature as your sidekick. While you and your sidekick are within 10 feet of one another, each of you can use a reaction to take half of an instance of damage dealt to the other.</p>
<p>Once you choose your sidekick, you cannot choose a new one until you complete a long rest. You can only have one sidekick at a time, so choosing a new sidekick removes the effects of this power from your previous sidekick.</p>
<h3 id="toc24"><span>Suplex</span></h3>
<p>When you hit a creature you are grappling with an unarmed strike using Pure Strength, you can move them to the space directly behind you if it is unoccupied, and knock them prone. The creature receives the strike's damage after they are knocked prone.</p>
<h3 id="toc25"><span>Unyielding</span></h3>
<p>You can cast the <a href="../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=396">Heroism</a> spell on yourself without using components, using Constitution as your spellcasting ability. Once you use this power, you must complete a long rest to use it again.</p>
<h3 id="toc26"><span>Valiant Soul</span></h3>
<p>You are immune to the frightened condition.</p>
<h3 id="toc27"><span>"Wham!"</span></h3>
<p>When you score a critical hit with an unarmed strike using Pure Strength, and the target is not prone, you can push the creature back 15 feet and knock them prone.</p>
<h3 id="toc28"><span>Wild Leap</span></h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 12 Dexterity</em><br>

Once you use this power, you must complete a long rest to use it again.</p>
<h3 id="toc34"><span>Shockwave</span></h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 5th level</em><br>
As an action on your turn, you can create a shockwave in front of you by punching the air. Creatures in a 15 foot cone in front of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your power save DC to avoid being knocked prone.</p>
