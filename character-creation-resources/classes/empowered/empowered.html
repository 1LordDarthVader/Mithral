<h1>Empowered</h1>
Unlike sorcerers, empowered beings have not been gifted mastery over magic. Instead, they have been given supernatural strength. They can punch with the weight of the world behind them, crush boulders, and are often capable of natural flight.
There are times when an empowered's abilities might seem akin to magic, but this would be a misunderstanding. What arcane abilities they do have are built directly into their physiology. If an empowered can summon lightning from their fingertips, an autopsy would likely find significant mutations in the empowered's hands.

<h2>Class Features</h2>
As an empowered, you gain the following class features.
<h3>Hit Points</h3>
<strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d12 per empowered level<br/>
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 12 + your Constitution modifier<br/>
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per empowered level after 1st
<h3>Proficiencies</h3>
<strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor<br/>
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons<br/>
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Constitution<br/>
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, and Stealth
<h3>Equipment</h3>
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
<ul>
    <li>(a) leather armor or (b) scale mail</li>
    <li>a simple weapon and an equipment pack</li>
    <li>a mask and cape with a design of your choosing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pure Strength</h3>
The first sign that you were empowered was your enhanced strength. While you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
    <li>You can attempt to grapple or shove a creature as a bonus action on your turn.</li>
    <li>Whenever you make an unarmed strike using Strength, you can roll a d8 in place of the strike's normal damage. The increases to a d10 at 11th level in this class.</li>
    <li>Whenever you make an unarmed strike using Strength, the strike deals an extra 1d4 damage if you are grappling the target or the target is prone. This die increases as you gain empowered levels, as shown in the Pure Strength column of the Empowered Table.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Vigor</h3>
You're a natural when it comes to feats of gymnastic strength. You gain proficiency in Athletics, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for Strength (Athletics) ability checks.
<h3>Strength Surge</h3>
At 2nd level, whenever you make a Strength check, you can summon up the power that dwells within you to roll an additional d20. You can use this feature after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the check. As you gain empowered levels, you might gain new abilities that will expend a use of this ability due to the immense effort they require.
<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h3>Astounding Powers</h3>
Due to the unique nature of their abilities, no two empowered beings are alike. As you begin to control your strength, you will gain distinct abilities and techniques known as <a href="./power-list.html">Astounding Powers</a>.
<br><br>
At 2nd level, you gain one power of your choice.
<br><br>
Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the powers you know and replace it with another power that you could learn at that level.
<br><br>
If an astounding power has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the power at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.
<br><br>
Some of your abilities might require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
<br><br>
<strong>Power save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier
<h3>Power Manifestation</h3>
Once you reach 3rd level, the source of your powers begins to truly manifest. The manifestation you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 13th, and 17th level.

<li><a href="./subclasses/titan-manifestation.html">Titan Manifestation</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/vigilante-manifestation.html">Vigilante Manifestation</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
<h3>Extra Attack</h3>
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
<h3>True Potential</h3>
At 5th level, you regain all expended uses of Strength Surge when you finish a short or long rest. Additionally, you are considered to be at least large in size when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
<h3>Inner Strength</h3>
At 6th level, the power within you allows your unarmed strikes to count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
<h3>Stopping Power</h3>
At 10th level, you can attempt to grapple creatures of any size. While you are grappling a creature that is two or more sizes larger than you, your speed is reduced to zero. While you are grappling a creature that is three or more sizes larger than you, the grapple forces the creature to drag you with them as they move instead of reducing their movement speed to zero.
<h3>Peerless Strength</h3>
Starting at 11th level, your Pure Strength now allows you to use a d10 in place of the normal damage for unarmed strikes you make using Strength instead of a d8.
<br><br>
Additionally, you can unleash a wild and deadly haymaker. Whenever you make an unarmed strike using Pure Strength, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the strike's damage.
<br><br>
Finally, when you reduce a creature's hit points to 0 with an unarmed strike using Pure Strength, you regain a single use of Strength Surge.
<h3>Never Say Die</h3>
At 14th level, you cling to life, even when most would give up. When making death saving throws, you regain 1 hit point and a single use of Strength Surge on a roll of 19 or 20.
<h3>Invincible</h3>
At 20th level, you've realized the full extent of your powers. You can use this feature at any time on your turn (no action required) to regain all expended uses of Strength Surge and become immune to all damage until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you must complete a long rest before using it again.
