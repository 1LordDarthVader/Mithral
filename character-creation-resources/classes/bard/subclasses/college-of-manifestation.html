        <h1>College of Manifestation</h1>
        Bards who study the ways of manifestation project their art into the world, literally. As they practice their art, they can magically form objects made of magical force that can manipulate the world around them as much or as little as they themselves could.<br><br>
A musician might summon a dancing sword to fight to the rhythm he plays. A painter may quickly paint a wall to block a passageway. A dancer might summon fiery ribbons to dance alongside her. The variety of possibilities is both dazzling and terrifying.
<h2>Artistic Projection</h2>
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to manifest your creative power into the world around you. As a bonus action, you can expend one of your Bardic inspirations to summon one of the following artistic projections, following their rules for how they are used and summoned.
<ul>
<li><strong>Barrier.</strong> You summon a wall of magical force within 30 feet of you. The wall is up to 15 feet wide, 10 feet tall and 5 feet thick. You can also have it or a circle of up to 10 feet in diameter or a 10 by 10 square with the same height and thickness. You choose what the wall looks like. It has an AC of 15 and hit point equals to the highest roll of your inspiration die times two times. Creatures you choose can pass through it, others must destroy it first.</li>
<li><strong>Guardian.</strong> You summon an interpretation of your desire to protect. You can give summon a guardian and attach it to a creature you choose within 30 feet. Once per turn, whenever that creature takes damage from an attack or spell, they can roll your inspiration die and decrease the damage taken by the amount rolled.</li>
<li><strong>Weapon.</strong> You can summon a weapon of magical force within 30 feet of you and make a melee spell attack with it. The attack deals your bardic inspiration die + your bard level in damage of a type of your choice. On subsequent turns you can use a bonus action to move the weapon up to 25 feet and repeat this attack, expending another inspiration die for each attack made.</li>
</ul>
Each projection only lasts for one minute unless re-summoned and you can only have one projection summoned at a time.
<h2>Duet Performance</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can create illusory copies of people so real that they are almost in discernable from their real counterpart in both appearance and skills.<br><br>
If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can choose a creature that witnessed the whole performance and create an illusory duet of them. You choose what the duet is wearing, but its body remains a complete replica of the subject.<br><br>
While the duet exists, it can interact with the world It can walk, climb, talk, and do any other mundane task except make attacks or cast spells. It can also perform skills checks of its own, using the same proficiencies and bonuses that the subject would have. Once it performs four checks, or if 8 hours have passed, or it takes damage, it dissipates into nothing. Stealth and perception check do not count against the number of checks it can make.<br><br>
Once you summon a duet, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Manifesting Performance</h2>
By 14th level, your mastery of your artistic projections allows you to spend time creating larger and large projections over longer periods of time.<br><br>
If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can summon a gargantuan or smaller object to within 120 feet of you that can be up to 30 feet tall. The object can be anything from a large rock or statue, a small structure, a section of a castle wall or other things created in the bard's imagination.<br><br>
The object remains for a number of hours equal to your bard level. It has an AC of 15 and hit points equal to 50 + five times your bard level. If it is reduced to zero hit points, or you use this feature again, it dissipates and all creatures in or on the object fall harmlessly to the ground.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
