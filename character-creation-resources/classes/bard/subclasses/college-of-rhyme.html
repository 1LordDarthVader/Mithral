<h1>College of Rhyme</h1>

Bards of the College of Rhyme are experts in the spoken word, able to compose verse and prose almost effortlessly. Some bards of this college compose epic ballads and sonnets, creating masterpieces of epic poetry. Others perform by improvising rhythmic poetry accompanied by music in taverns and mead halls, competing in contests of wit and verbal mastery.

<br><br>Whether practicing language to capture the splendor of great deeds or to spit out 'sick burns', the bards of this college are prepared for a life of excitement and epic verses.

<h2>Student of Diction</h2>
When you join the College of Rhyme at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Deception and Persuasion. You learn the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=813">Vicious Mockery</a> cantrip if you don't already know it, or another bard cantrip of your choice if you do.

<h2>Epic Verses</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, when you cast vicious mockery, if the target fails their saving throw you can expend a Bardic Inspiration to compose a verse of...

<br><br><strong>Hubris.</strong> You gain temporary hit points equal the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die + the damage dealt by vicious mockery.
<br><br><strong>Tragedy.</strong> The target takes additional damage equal to amount rolled on the inspiration die, and has disadvantage for an additional attack from vicious mockery.
<br><br><strong>Comedy.</strong> If the target attempts to attack anyone other than you before the start of their next turn, you can roll a die equal to your inspiration die and subtract it from their attack roll.

<h2>Battle Poetry</h2>
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals Psychic damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

<br><br>Additionally, as a reaction to the end of an incapacitation effect another creature suffered form one of your spells, or to them missing an attack that had disadvantage caused by your vicious mockery, you can deal a verbal follow up dealing Psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

<h2>Master Linguist</h2>
Additionally at 6th level, your ability to communicate transcends barriers of language. You can communicate basic concepts to creatures that don't share a language with you as long that creature speaks at least one language through intonation, body language, gestures, and attitude.

<br><br>Using this method you can get information such as how much something should cost, where a notable locations are, what might be edible, and which paths or alleyways should be avoided, as well other things your DM might find appropriate for you to be able to learn from them.

<br><br>You also gain the ability to read these basic concepts from written thieves' cant.

<h2>Rapid Epithets</h2>
Starting at 14th level, your can deliver verbal components to spells with blinding speed and precision. You can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to cast a spell with the cast time of one action as a bonus action as long as it only has verbal components.
