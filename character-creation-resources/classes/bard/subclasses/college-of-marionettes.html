        <h1>College of Marionettes</h1>
        The College of Marionettes are a guild of puppeteers that turn the movement of wooden dolls into a masterpiece of animation. Using their nimble fingers and magic string, they can even control the bodies of the living and animate the dead to follow their precise instructions.
<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
When you join the College of Marionettes at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Performance and Sleight of Hand.
<h2>Puppet Familiar</h2>
At 3rd level, you learn find familiar if you didn't already know it. This spell does not count against your number of spells known. The spirit of your familiar summoned with this spell can occupy a puppet or marionette doll, which in turn can move of its own volition as your familiar, using the Living Puppet stats found below.<br><br>
Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own. When your familiar makes an attack, it uses your spell attack bonus instead of its own attack bonus on attack rolls, and you may add your proficiency bonus to its damage rolls.<br><br>
When you communicate with your familiar telepathically, you can also take precise control of its actions, allowing your puppet to use your ability or skill modifier for an ability check.

<h2>Soul Strings</h2>
By 6th level, as an action expending a Bardic Inspiration die, you can project from your fingertips barely noticeable strands of energy which can attach to creatures. Choose a living creature you can see within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, your strings attach to the creature for a number of rounds equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die, after which the strings are broken and this effect ends. At the end of each of its turns, an affected creature can make a new saving throw against this effect, ending it on a success.<br><br>
While your strings are attached to a creature, it is under your complete control. You can use your action each turn to maintain precise control of the target. It takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. You cannot command an activity that would result in certain death. You can also cause the creature to use a reaction, by using your own reaction as well.<br><br>
While your strings are attached, you can take no other actions or move further than 30 feet from your target without you breaking the strings and ending the effect.
<h2>Master of Puppets</h2>
Beginning at 14th level, your soul strings can attach to the bodies of dead creatures and inanimate objects.<br><br>
As an action, you can expend a Bardic Inspiration die to affect a single target within 30 feet with the animate dead or animate objects spell, as appropriate, which takes affect instantaneously without expending a spell slot or spell components. The duration of this spell is a number of rounds equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die and does not require concentration. You can only animate a single target at a time in this manner, and animating another target breaks your control over an existing target animated by this feature.
