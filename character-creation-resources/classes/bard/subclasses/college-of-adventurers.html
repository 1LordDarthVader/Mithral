        <h1>College of Adventurers</h1>

        Bards from the College of Adventurers learn from heroes of old and stories of legend. Bards are jacks of all trades, and for the College of Adventurers this statement rings ever true. They combine all the useful skills of their companions into one, allowing them to be versatile and supportive. While not having a direct goal, many adventurer-studying bards live to tell tales of other heroes or seek to create their own. Stories of heroic deeds, tales of cunning, magical anomalies, or godly might fuel the life-blood of these bards.

        <h2>Talented Adventurer</h2>
        Starting when you choose this bardic college at 3rd level, you gain an adventurer's talent of your choice. Your adventurer's talent options are detailed at the end of this bardic college description. You gain an additional adventurer's talent of your choice at 6th level and again at 14th level.

        <h2>Party Planner</h2>
        Also at 3rd level, while a creature has one of your Bardic Inspiration dice, it can use a bonus action on each of its turns to take the Help action.

        <h2>Well-Rounded</h2>
        At 6th level, choose one skill, tool, and language. You gain proficiency in the chosen skill and with the chosen tool, and you can speak, read, and write the chosen language.

        <h2>Improvisational Talent</h2>
        Starting at 14th level, when you finish a long rest, you can choose one adventurer's talent you know and replace it with one you don't.

        <h2>Adventurer's Talents</h2>
        <h3>Artificer</h3>
        You gain proficiency with three tools of your choice, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for checks made with the chosen tools.
        <br><br>In addition, you can use a set of tools you are proficient with as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.
        <h3>Atavist</h3>
        When you deal damage, you can take damage equal to any amount of d4s to add the result to the damage.  This damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any way.
        <h3>Barbarian</h3>
        On your turn, you can enter a rampage as a bonus action. While rampaging and not wearing heavy armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. You can't concentrate on spells while rampaging. Your rampage lasts for 1 minute but ends early if you are knocked unconscious. Once you have rampaged, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
        <h3>Blood Hunter</h3>
        You learn one blood curse of your choice.  You can use it once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.  For the purpose of amplification, your Hemocraft Die is the same size as your Bardic Inspiration Die.
        <h3>Cleric</h3>
        As a bonus action, you choose a creature within 30 feet. The chosen creature gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + half your level in this class for 10 minutes. While a creature has temporary hit points granted by this spell, they can choose to lose these temporary hit points when they hit a creature with an attack, dealing additional radiant damage equal to the temporary hit points they lost. Once you use this talent, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
        <h3>Druid</h3>
        You can cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=576">Polymorph</a> spell without expending a spell slot. If you cast the polymorph spell with this trait, you can only transform yourself into a beast with a CR less than half your level in this class. Once you cast the spell with this trait, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
        <br><br>In addition, you can speak, read, and write Druidic.
        <h3>Empowered</h3>
        You gain one astounding power of your choice. If an astounding power has a level requirement, you use half your level in this class to determine your eligibility. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the powers you have and replace it with another power that you could have at that level.
        <h3>Fighter</h3>
        You gain proficiency with martial weapons and shields. You also choose and learn one of the Fighting Styles available to the fighter class.
        <h3>Harbinger</h3>
        You gain an entropy point whenever you reduce a creature of CR 1/2 or higher to 0 hit points, and can have up to 2 entropy points.  In addition, you learn one of the Entropic Empowering options available to the harbinger class.
        <br><br>In addition, you can speak, read, and write Apocalyptic.
        <h3>Juggernaut</h3>
        You gain proficiency with medium armor and shields.  You also choose and learn one of the Juggernaut Specialty options available to the juggernaut class.
        <h3>Mentor</h3>
        You gain your choice of the Strike Now, Hidden Reserves, or Time Heals features available to the mentor class.  You can use your Bardic Inspiration dice in place of a mentor's Bided Time dice when you use your chosen feature.
        <h3>Monk</h3>
        While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, you can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and you can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. When you use the Attack action and only make attacks with unarmed strikes on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
        <h3>Mystic</h3>
        You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 120 feet of you in this manner. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself.
        <h3>Paladin</h3>
        When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 1d6 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d6. The damage increases by 1d6 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d6. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all uses of this feature at the end of a long rest.
        <h3>Ranger</h3>
        You learn the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=407">Hunter's Mark</a> spell, which counts as a bard spell for you but does not count against your bard spells known. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot as if you had expended your highest spell slot. Once you cast the spell using this talent, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
        <h3>Rogue</h3>
        You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
        <h3>Savant</h3>
        If you spend at least 1 minute observing something, you can recall any information about it, at any point in the future, without requiring an ability check.
        <h3>Sorcerer</h3>
        You have 2 sorcery points and learn one of the following Metamagic options available to the sorcerer class: Careful Spell, Distant Spell, Empowered Spell, Extended Spell, Quickened Spell, or Subtle Spell.
        <br><br>In addition, you can use an action and expend a spell slot to gain sorcery points equal to the level of the spell slot expended. When you finish a long rest, you reset to 2 sorcery points. When you gain a level in this class, you can replace the Metamagic option you know and replace it with another Metamagic option from the list.
        <h3>Warlock</h3>
        You learn one eldritch invocation of your choice. If an eldritch invocation has a level requirement, you use half your level in this class to determine your eligibility. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.
        <h3>Wizard</h3>
        You learn any two spells from the arcane spell list that are of a level you can cast. These count as bard spells for you but do not count against your number of bard spells known. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the arcane spells you know and replace it with another spell from the arcane spell list of a level you can cast.
