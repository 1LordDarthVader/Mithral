        <h1>College of Blazing Strings</h1>
        The sound of music can be a calming thing to the ears of those who understand it. It can take the edge off of those heavy emotions that threaten to turn mortal minds mad. But Bards of the Blazing Strings needs it for another reason. They were born with great sorcerous power but lacked the ability to control it, presenting a clear and constant threat to those around them.<br><br>
But with the power of music, they can focus their energies into their songs and ballads and create a wonderful display of their power that can inspire and audience with a brilliant show of arcane lights. Or burn down the performance hall as they focus the truly terrifying power within them through the sound of their instrument.
<h2>Fiery Cantrips</h2>
When you join the college of blazing strings at 3rd level, you know the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=157">Control Flames</a> and <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=169">Create Bonfire</a> cantrips. These count as bard cantrips to you and don't count against the number of cantrips you know.
<h2>Mote of Flames</h2>
At 3rd level, you've learned to control your destructive potential by creating a small mote of ire that appears when you play music.<br><br>
When you roll initiative, or begin to play music, you can place your mote of lames within 10 feet of you. The mote hovers 5 feet off the ground and sheds bright light around it up to 20 feet with 10 feet of dim light beyond that. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to move the mote up to 25 feet in any direction. Once you've moved it, you can choose and spend one of your bardic inspirations to have it make a ranged spell attack against a target you can see within 30 feet of it. The attack deals fire damage equal to what you roll on the inspiration die + your spellcasting ability modifier.<br><br>
The mote remains until you are out of combat or so long you continue to play music.
<h2>Ballad of the Inferno</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can spend a bonus action to begin performing a ballad of the inferno. While you are performing this ballad, you can use an action to cast a spell that deals fire damage, either through your self or your mote of flames.<br><br>
However, you can only cast an amount of spells with a combined total number of spell slots equal to your bard level.<br><br>
You cannot cast any other kind of spell while you are performing the ballad, and the ballad also only lasts up to a minute, or until you end it as a bonus action, or you become incapacitated.
<h2>Searing Passions</h2>
Starting at 14th level, your raw emotion acts as a powerful kindling to the fires you create. You gain resistance to ire damage, and any ire damage you deal ignores resistances, and treats immunity as resistance.
