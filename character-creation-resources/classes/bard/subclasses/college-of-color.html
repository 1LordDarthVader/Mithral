        <h1>College of Color</h1>
        Where other bards channel their creativity through an instrument, some choose to express themselves through painting. They attune to the colors of the world, becoming able to shape reality in ways few would think possible. Bards of the College of color also gain different abilities depending on which colors they favor, and as varied as a painter's palette.
<h2>Bonus Proficiencies</h2>
When you join the college of color at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Painter's supplies. You can use these supplies as your spellcasting focus, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it.
<h2>Palette</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you learn to temporarily attune to a set of colors. Select a number of colors equal to your proficiency bonus. You can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration as an action to target a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, including yourself. An unwilling target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be affected by one of the colors you selected. You can change your selection after a short or long rest.
<h3>Red</h3>
The target is struck by sudden anger. For 10 minutes, they add a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die to all Strength ability checks and saving throws.
<h3>Orange</h3>
The target is consumed by a surge of willpower. The target may immediately reroll a saving throw to end an effect causing them to be frightened, adding a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die to the roll and for all saving throws against being frightened for the next 10 minutes.
<h3>Yellow</h3>
The target experiences spontaneous feelings of joy. For 10 minutes, the target adds a roll your Bardic Inspiration die to all its Charisma ability checks and saving throws.
<h3>Green</h3>
The target is painted with a mixture of greens. For 10 minutes, the target adds a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die to all their Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
<h3>Blue</h3>
The target experiences a moment of elucidating clarity. The target may immediately reroll a saving throw to end an effect causing them to be charmed, adding a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die to the roll and for all saving throws against being charmed for the next 10 minutes.
<h3>Purple</h3>
The target is consumed by feelings of pride and superiority. They gain temporary hit points equal to your Bard level plus the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die until the end of your next turn.
<h3>Black</h3>
The target is overwhelmed by horror and dread. For 1 minute, the target becomes frightened of you or one creature or object you designate within range that it can see. The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success.
<h3>White</h3>
The target is enveloped by feelings of pleasant serenity. For 1 minute, the target cannot be hostile to other creatures. If the target was hostile before you used this feature, they become indifferent for the duration. This effect ends early if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses its friends being harmed.
<h2>Life Imitates Art</h2>
At 6th level, your paintings become almost perfect copies of reality. You can cast alter self without expending a spell slot or providing material components. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), regaining expended uses on a long rest.<br><br>
Furthermore, as part of your action when you cast a spell of the Illusion school, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration. The DC of the check to detect it as an illusion is increased by the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.
<h2>Chromatic Explosion</h2>
Starting at 14th level, as an action you can paint an evershifting cascade of color in the air. All creatures of your choice within 30 feet that can see the shifting colored shapes must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature becomes stunned for a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. At the end of each of their subsequent turns, creatures stunned by this feature can attempt to make the save again, ending the effect on a success.<br><br>
Once you have used this feature you cannot use it again until you have finished a short or long rest.
