        <h1>College of Lyrics</h1>
        Bards of the College of Lyrics are experts in the spoken word, able to compose verse and prose almost effortlessly. Rather than the conventional ballads and sonnets, these bards perform by improvising rhythmic poetry accompanied by music. They often gather in taverns or mead halls to participate in contests of wit and verbal mastery, in which two bards recite insulting poems about each other while the audience decides who got the better of the exchange.
<h2>Street Swagger</h2>
When you join the College of Lyrics at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Deception and Intimidation. You learn the Vicious Mockery cantrip if you don't already know it, or another bard cantrip of your choice if you do.
<h2>Lyrical Flow</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, when your land a line, you're on a roll; when you cast vicious mockery if the target fails their saving throw you can expend a Bardic Inspiration to unleash your lyrical genius to&#8230;
<ul>
<li><strong>Engrandize Yourself.</strong> You gain temporary hit points equal the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die + the damage dealt by vicious mockery.</li>
<li><strong>Double Down.</strong> The target takes additional damage equal to amount rolled on the inspiration die, and has disadvantage for an additional attack from vicious mockery.</li>
<li><strong>Make it Personal.</strong> If the target attempts to attack anyone other than you before the start of their next turn, you can roll a die equal to your inspiration die and subtract it from their attack roll.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sick Burns</h2>
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals Psychic damage, you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to one damage roll of that spell.<br><br>
Additionally, as a reaction to the end of an incapacitation effect another creature suffered form one of your spells or to them missing an attack that had disadvantage caused by your vicious mockery, you can deal a verbally devastating follow up dealing psychic damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
<h2>Lingo of the People</h2>
Additionally at 6th level, your ability to communicate transcends barriers of language. You can communicate basic concepts to creatures that don't share a language with you as long that creature speaks at least one language through intonation, body language, gestures, attitude, and swaggering about.<br><br>
Using this method you can get information such as how much something should cost, where a notable locations are, who the toughest person or thing around is, where the best intoxicants are served, what might be edible, and which paths or alleyways should be avoided, as well other things your DM might find appropriate for you to be able to learn from them.<br><br>
You also gain the ability to read these basic concepts from written thieves' cant.
<h2>Spitting Fire</h2>
Starting at 14th level, your can deliver verbal components to spells with blinding speed and precision. You can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to cast a spell with the cast time of one action as a bonus action as long as it only has verbal components.
