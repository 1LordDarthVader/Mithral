        <h1>Oath of Treachery</h1>
        The Oath of Treachery is the path followed by paladins who have forsworn other oaths or who care only for their own power and survival. Commonly known as blackguards, these profane warriors are faithful only to themselves. Anyone desperate enough to follow one of these paladins does so because, while deceitful, these paladins command great power. Those who follow them without falling prey to their treachery hope to indulge in wanton violence and accumulate great treasure.<br><br>
Many of these paladins pay homage to demon lords, especially Grazz't and Orcus. Even the Lords of Hell are loath to ally with these champions of chaos, but sometimes Baalzebul and Glasya find a kindred spirit in a blackguard's penchant for double dealing and treachery.

<h2>Conjure Duplicate</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can create an illusory duplicate of yourself to confuse your enemies.<br><br>
You can use a bonus action to magically manifest a duplicate of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This duplicate is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another duplicate, or until you're incapacitated.<br><br>
Your duplicate has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the duplicate to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your duplicate is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.
<ul>
<li>As a bonus action, you can teleport, magically swapping places with your duplicate at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.</li>
<li>When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the duplicate's space. You make this choice for each attack. When you cast a spell with a range other than Self, you can cast the spell from your duplicate's space.</li>
<li>When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your duplicate moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the duplicate's space.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Channel Divinity: Poison Strike</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to make a weapon deadlier. As a bonus action, you touch one weapon or piece of ammunition and conjure a special poison on it. The poison lasts for 1 minute. The next time you hit a target with an attack using that weapon or ammunition, the target takes poison damage immediately after the attack. The poison damage equals 2d10 + your paladin level, or 20 + your paladin level if you had advantage on the attack roll.
<h2>Cull the Herd</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that has one or more of its allies within 5 feet of it.
<h2>Traitor's Escape</h2>
At 15th level, you have the ability to slip away from your foes. Immediately after you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to a spot you can see. You remain invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force a creature to make a saving throw. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
<h2>Icon of Deceit</h2>
At 20th level, you gain the ability to emanate feelings of treachery. As an action, you can magically become an avatar of deceit, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:
<ul>
<li>You are invisible.</li>
<li>If a creature damages you on its turn, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or you control its next action, provided that you aren't incapacitated when it takes the action. A creature automatically succeeds on the save if the creature is immune to being charmed.</li>
<li>If you have advantage on an attack roll, you gain a bonus to its damage roll equal to your paladin level.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
