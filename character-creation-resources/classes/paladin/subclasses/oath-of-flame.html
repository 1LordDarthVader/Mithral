        <h1>Oath of Flame</h1>
        The power of the cleansing flame of vengeance is a useful tool to the gods. They can empower a noble champion with this power, transforming that champion into a paladin of the Oath of Flame. Commonly called fiery avengers, these noble knights serve their god's will across the land, punishing those who would harm innocents. Paladins who make this oath tend to be loyal and determined, but also extremely stubborn.

<h2>Flame Soul</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you gain weak fiery magic that you can use to perform smaller tasks than your normal divine magic would allow. You learn two of the following cantrips. They are considered paladin spells for you.
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=47">Ascending Flame</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=139">Conflagrate</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=157">Control Flames</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=169">Create Bonfire</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=288">Fire Bolt</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=354">Green-Flame Blade</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=596">Produce Flame</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=785">Tormenting Flame</a></li>
</ul>
In addition, you are considered acclimated to a cold environment, as your inner flame keeps you warm.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Pyroburst</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to cause a burst of fiery energy to radiate from you. Creatures within 20 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. Creatures that fail their saving throw take 2d8 fire damage and are pushed 10 feet away from you in a straight line. Creatures that succeed their saving throw take half as much damage and aren't pushed. Unsecured objects within range are pushed in a straight line until they are 30 feet away from you. Flammable objects within range are set alight.
<h2>Aura of Heat</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you radiate an aura of unbearable heat. Creatures of your choice that start their turns within 10 feet of you take fire damage equal to half your spellcasting ability modifier, rounding down (minimum of 1). The range of this aura increases to 30 feet at 18th level, and its damage increases to equal your spellcasting ability modifier.<br><br>
In addition, you gain resistance to fire damage.
<h2>Divine Rebuke</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you can punish those that strike you or your allies. When a creature you can see hits you or a creature within 5 feet of you with a melee attack, you can cast the Hellish Rebuke spell at 1st-level on that creature without expending a spell slot.
<h2>Fiery Avenger</h2>
Starting at 20th level, as an action you can temporarily take on your true form, that of the fiery avenger. Wings made of incorporeal fire sprout from your back, and your weapons are wreathed in divine flame. You gain the following benefits for the next minute:
<ul>
<li>You have a flying speed of 60 feet.</li>
<li>Your weapon attacks deal an additional 2d6 fire damage.</li>
<li>You gain immunity to fire damage and resistance to cold damage.</li>
</ul>
You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can also expend a 5th-level spell slot to use this feature again.
