        <h1>Oath of Perfection</h1>
        Sometimes, piety is not the only reason for a paladin to receive power from a deity. Sometimes it's devotion to an idea such as mercy, protection, or smiting evil. Others, however, are devoted to one single idea: perfection.<br><br>
Commonly known as mirror knights, knight radiants, or knights of the vain table, these warriors' bodies are perfect, and their actions are performed with absolute grace and skill. This has caused many entities to offer these bastions of vanity a place at their side in return for giving them the power to take their perfection above and beyond what is possible with mortal powers.

<h2>Peak of Perfection</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as an action, you reveal your radiant physical form to all who can see. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you that can see you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the start of your next turn.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Channel Divinity: None But I</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, your vanity gives your power over yourself that others could never dream of. As a bonus action, you can expend your Channel Divinity to end any magical effects of your choice on yourself.
<h2>Aura of the Peerless</h2>
Starting at 7th level, failure becomes difficult when you are around. Whenever you or a creature of your choice within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll or ability check, they can roll a d6 and add it to the roll. They can't do so again until the start of your next turn.<br><br>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
<h2>Grand Reflection</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you are always under the effect of the Mirror Image spell, except you only have a single duplicate at all times.
<h2>Nimbus of Perfection</h2>
At 20th level, you can assume a form of absolute perfection that only the gods themselves are capable of achieving. As an action, you gain the following benefits for 1 hour:
<ul>
<li>Whenever you or a creature of your choice within 30 feet of you make a skill check, treat any roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</li>
<li>The die used by your Aura of the Peerless changes to a d10.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
