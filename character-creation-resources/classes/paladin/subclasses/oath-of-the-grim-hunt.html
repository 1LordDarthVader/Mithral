        <h1>Oath of the Grim Hunt</h1>
        The oath of the grim hunt is a calling that requires its followers to seek out and destroy the many evils the stalk the mortal realms. Often called Grim knights, or Knight Slayers, these hunters dedicate themselves, body and soul, to hunting down the monstrous, the wicked, and the mutated, destroying them with a burning, merciless prejudice.

<h2>Merciless Crippling</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as an action, you can horribly cripple a creature with divine power. Choose a creature within 60ft of you. They must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have their lying and burrowing speeds are reduced to 0, and their movement speed halved for 1 minute.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Hunt's End</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, whenever you hit a creature with a melee attack, and use your Divine Smite feature, you can use your Channel Divinity to increase the damage dice of the smite to d10's instead of a d8's.<br><br>
If the target is an aberration, fiend, undead, or monstrosity, the die increases to a d12.
<h2>Beacon of Cleansing</h2>
Beginning at 7th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you is under the effects of a spell or other effect that allows it to repeat a saving throw at the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw at the start of its turn instead, possibly ending the effect early.<br><br>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
<h2>The Living Inevitable</h2>
Starting at 15th level, You can no longer be charmed or paralyzed, and you can't be sensed or scryed upon by divination magics unless you want to be.
<h2>Divine Monstrosity</h2>
At 20th level, you can can take the form of a divine monster for 1 minute as if under the effects of the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=664">Shapechange</a> spell.<br><br>
The divine monster has the same statistics as a Planetar, though it lacks the Innate Spellcasting and Healing Touch traits. You choose what this form looks like, and the form cannot be dispelled by magic.<br><br>
Additionally, while transformed, you radiate an aura of menace while you're not incapacitated. The aura extends 30 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. Hostile creatures within the aura can't regain hit points, and lose resistance to any damage types.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
