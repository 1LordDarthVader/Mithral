        <h1>Oath of Vengeance</h1>
        The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside – at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins – sometimes called avengers or dark knights – their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.

<h2>Vow of Enmity</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can vow to destroy one target.<br><br>
As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Abjure Enemy</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.<br><br>
On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature's speed is 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.<br><br>
On a successful save, the creature's speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.
<h2>Relentless Avenger</h2>
By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe's retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
<h2>Soul of Vengeance</h2>
Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.
<h2>Avenging Angel</h2>
At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.</li>
<li>You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a</li>
<li>Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
