        <h1>Oath of Justice</h1>
        The Oath of Justice is a commitment not the tenets of good or evil but a holy vow sworn to uphold the law. When lawlessness threatens the peace, those who swear the Oath of Justice intervene to maintain order and ensure that criminals are suitably punished. Sometimes called adjudicators, some of these paladins are patriots to a state, while others are sheriffs or vigilantes enforcing law in the absence of any civil authority—or even defying the authorities so as to pay obeisance to some greater governing principle.

<h2>Shackles of Justice</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as an action, you can bind a creature with your divine power. Choose a creature within 60 feet of you. They must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have their flying and burrowing speeds reduced to 0, and their movement speed halved for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Turn the Lawless</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as an action, you can utter a prayer that is painful to creatures of chaos. You display your holy symbol and speak your condemnatory prayer, using your Channel Divinity. Each aberration, demon, or fey that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.<br><br>
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
<h2>Thief Catcher</h2>
At 7th level, when an enemy moves within 10 feet of you, you may use a reaction to stop them during the move with an invisible hand. The enemy makes a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a fail, all of their movement speeds are reduced to 0 until the beginning of their next turn. You may also choose to pull a creature that fails this save up to 10 feet towards you. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.<br><br>
At 18th level, the range of this ability increases to 30 feet.
<h2>Punish the Guilty</h2>
Once you reach 15th level, when you are hit by an attack and receive damage, you may use a reaction to take half the triggering damage and cause the attacking creature to take the same amount of damage.<br><br>
Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Bringer of Justice</h2>
At 20th level you can, as an action, become the very embodiment of law and justice itself. Your eyes begin to glow slightly with a dim light, and you are empowered to mete out justice against all criminals who would seek to escape the hands of the law. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>You have truesight out to 120 feet.</li>
<li>Attacks against you are made with disadvantage.</li>
<li>When you take the Attack action, you make all the attacks with advantage.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
