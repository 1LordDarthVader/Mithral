<h2>Peerless Athlete</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, your athletic abilities are the stuff of legend. You gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>You have proficiency in the Acrobatics and Athletics skills. If you already have proficiency in one of the skills, your proficiency bonus is doubled for checks made with it.</li>
<li>You count as one size larger for the purposes of determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, and lift.</li>
<li>The distance of your long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Channel Divinity: Inspiring Smite</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, immediately after you deal damage to a creature with your Divine Smite feature, you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action and distribute temporary hit points to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you, which can include you. The total number of temporary hit points equals 2d8 + your level in this class, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.
<h2>Aura of Alacrity</h2>
At 7th level, you emanate an aura that fills you and your companions with supernatural speed, allowing you to race across a battlefield in formation. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, if you aren't incapacitated, the walking speed of any ally who starts their turn within 5 feet of you increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.<br><br>
When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of the aura increases to 10 feet.
<h2>Glorious Defense</h2>
When you reach 15th level, you can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus to the target's AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your spell casting ability modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of this reaction, provided the attacker is within your weapon's range.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spell casting ability modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Living Legend</h2>
At 20th level, you can empower yourself with the legends - whether true or exaggerated - of your great deeds. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
<ul>
<li>You are blessed with an otherworldly presence, gaining advantage on all Charisma checks.</li>
<li>Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead.</li>
<li>If you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to reroll it. You must use this new roll.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
