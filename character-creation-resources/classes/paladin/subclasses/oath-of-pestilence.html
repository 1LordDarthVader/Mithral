<h1>Oath of Pestilence</h1>

Clad in grime-soaked armor and wielding rusting weapons, the Oath of Pestilence paladin spreads corruption, disease, and filth. Bound by an oath which infests their bodies with all manner of plagues, these heralds of decay lumber forward with unholy toughness and grim resolve.

<h2>Channel Divinity: Entropic Infection</h2>

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to weaken a creature against entropic energies. As an action, you can force a creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, for the next minute the creature takes an additional 2d6 damage the first time it takes necrotic damage each turn. During this time, the creature loses resistance to necrotic damage if it has it.

<h2>Debilitating Fever</h2>

Also at 3rd level, your touch inflicts disease. You can use your action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach that isn't a construct or undead.On a hit, the creature becomes diseased and is incapacitated until the start of your next turn.

<br><br>Since this ability induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it.

<br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Aura of Rampant Sickness</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you emit an aura of contagion and virulence to a range of 10 feet. When a creature within your aura makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw you can give that roll disadvantage as a reaction.

<br><br>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

<h2>Disgusting Resilience</h2>
At 15th level, when you take damage which would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can choose to expend any number of Hit Dice. Roll those dice and subtract the result from the damage taken. If this reduces the damage to 0, you don't take any damage.

<br><br>In addition, if you are killed your corpse violently explodes in a shower of pus and gore, dealing 8d6 necrotic damage to creatures within 20 feet of you that fail a Constitution saving throw.

<h2>Plaguebringer</h2>
At 20th level, you become an avatar of plague, which gives you the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>You have resistance to necrotic damage and are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition.</li>
    <li>Your hit point maximum can't be reduced.</li>
</ul>

Creatures of your choice who start their turn within 5 feet of you, or who move within 5 feet of you on their turn, take necrotic damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. Once a creature takes damage from this ability, it can't take damage from it again until the start of its next turn.
