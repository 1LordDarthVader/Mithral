<h1>Oath of Mysticism</h1>

Where most paladins swear Oaths to a divine cause or ideal, some swear an Oath to themselves, vowing to awaken their own inner power. Known as Mystic Knights, these paladins spend years in secluded places, mastering the psionic power that lies dormant within their own mind. Once their mind has been awakened, these psionic warriors venture out into the world looking to bring enlightenment to all they meet.

<h2>Channel Divinity: Focus Mind</h2>

Starting at 3rd level, as a reaction to becoming Frightened, Charmed, or afflicted by negative mental status from failing an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you may expend your Channel Divinity to immediately end the effect.

<h2>Psionic Smite</h2>

Also at 3rd level, you can cause your strikes to carry psionic energy with them.  When you use your Divine Smite feature, you can choose to replace its damage type with psychic.  If you do so, the target must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC.  On a failed saving throw, the target is unable to cast spells or use psionic abilities until the end of its next turn.

<br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Mystic Enlightenment</h2>
Beginning at 7th level, you make your saves against effects that allow you to save at the end of end of your turn at the start of your turn instead.

<br><br>Starting at 18th level, you can use your reaction to extend this benefit to another creature you can see that starts their turn within 30 feet of you and are under an effect they can attempt to make a save against at the end of their turn.

<h2>Active Mind</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you can no longer be surprised, and you can see and hear while unconscious as long as your have at least 1 hit point remaining.

<br><br>Additionally, when you roll for Initiative, if the total result of your roll is less than your passive Perception, you can replace the result with the value of your passive Perception.

<h2>Awoken</h2>
At 20th level, as an action, you can fully perceive the world around you for what it is, piecing the veils that hide. You gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

<ul>
    <li>You gain truesight with a range of 120 feet.</li>
    <li>You are immune to psychic damage.</li>
    <li>You have advantage on saving throws against magical or psionic effects.</li>
    <li>When you strike an enemy with a Divine Smite you can choose to cast <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=213">Dispel Magic</a> on the target as a bonus action without expending a spell slot. If the level of the spell slot spent on Divine Smite was higher than 3rd level, you cast dispel magic at the level of spell slot spent.</li>
</ul>

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
