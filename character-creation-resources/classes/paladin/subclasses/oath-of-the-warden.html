        <h1>Oath of the Warden</h1>
        The Wardens is a secretive order of Knights, unorganized but sharing a singular set of tenets they all abide by. United in their opposition to the pervasive and alien threat of aberrant horrors from the Far Plane.<br><br>
Pursuing a lonely crusade for the greater good, they understand that in order to preserve the realm against the horrors of the cosmos they have to take matters into their own hands. Those paladins acquire abilities that ward them from magical effects and help them smite aberrations.

<h2>Focus Mind</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as a reaction when you become frightened, charmed, or afflicted by negative mental status from failing an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you may immediately end the effect.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Turn the Aberrant</h2>
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring aberrations, using your Channel Divinity. Each aberration or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.<br><br>
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move into a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.<br><br>
A creature's true form is revealed while it is turned.
<h2>Aura of Binding</h2>
Beginning at 7th level, you project an grounding aura against the warping of space around you. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet attempting to teleport or cross planar boundaries must pass a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the spell slot or resource is not expended but the action fails and is wasted.<br><br>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
<h2>Constant Vigilance</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you can no longer be surprised, and you can see and hear while unconscious as long as your have at least 1 hit point remaining. Additionally, when you roll for Initiative, if the total result of your roll is less than your passive Perception, you can replace the result with the value of your passive Perception.
<h2>Awoken</h2>
At 20th level, as an action, you can fully perceive the world around you for what it is, piecing the veils that hide. You gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
<ul>
<li>You gain truesight with a range of 120 feet.</li>
<li>You are immune to psychic damage.</li>
<li>When you hit with a Divine Smite, they suffer the effects of dispel magic cast at the level of the spell slot expended.</li>
<li>You gain infinite uses of your Focus Mind feature.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
