        <h1>Oath of Freedom</h1>
        Most paladins place great emphasis on duty, honesty, order and justice, believing that an orderly approach to life is the best way to keep their tenets and accomplish their objectives. The Paladins of Freedom, however, reject this approach. Instead, they stress that personal liberty is the most important thing an individual can have.<br><br>
The Oath of Freedom ties paladins to the ideals of liberty and personal agency above all else. Paladins of this oath resemble skirmishers more than they do knights in shining armor. They use their skills to free the oppressed and defend them from oppressors. For this reason, kings, queens, and other rulers are often suspicious of Freedom paladins—for where these paladins go, revolution may soon follow.

<h2>Freedom from Chains</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to inspire others to rise against their oppressors. All friendly creatures other than yourself within 30 feet of you can use their reaction to stand if they are prone or to make an ability check or saving throw to attempt to escape from being grappled or restrained.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Chaotic Strike</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your Channel Divinity when you hit with a weapon attack to strike with the powers of chaos. The attack inflicts extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your paladin level. The number on the d6 determines the type of the extra damage. A target that takes the damage must make a Constitution saving throw or also experience an additional effect based on the damage type.

<h2>Aura of Mobility</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you are unaffected by magical and nonmagical difficult terrain while you are conscious.<br><br>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
<h2>Free Spirited</h2>
At 15th level, when you use your action to Dash or Disengage, you can make a single weapon attack as a bonus action.
<h2>Limitless</h2>
At 20th level, you break free of all bonds and restrictions. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>You gain a flying speed of 90 feet.</li>
<li>You are under the effects of a freedom of movement spell.</li>
<li>You are immune to enchantment spells you do not choose to be affected by.</li>
<li>You can move through creatures and objects. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.</li>
<li>When you inflict damage on a creature, you ignore its damage resistances.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
