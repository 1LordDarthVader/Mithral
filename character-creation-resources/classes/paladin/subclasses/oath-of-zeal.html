<h1>Oath of Zeal</h1>

The Oath of Zeal is taken by paladins consumed by hatred for a specific group or ideology. Zealots, as these paladins are sometimes called, pursue an inquisition against their enemies at all costs. They abandon compassion and honor as impediments to the more important work of ridding the world of those they deem dangerous or heretical.

<h2>Channel Divinity: Inquisitor's Eye</h2>

Starting at 3rd level, You can use your Channel Divinity to open your senses to hidden signs of corruption and malfeasance. As a bonus action, you grant yourself advantage on Intelligence (Investigation), Wisdom (Insight), and Wisdom (Perception) ability checks for the next 10 minutes. During this time, you can't be surprised.

<h2>Mark of the Heretic</h2>

Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet and a weeping symbol appears on it. For the next minute, your weapon attacks against the chosen creature score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Aura of Clarity</h2>
Beginning at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be blinded while you are conscious. Additionally, creatures and objects of your choice within this range can't benefit from being invisible.

<br><br>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

<h2>Compel Confession</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you can cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=859">Zone of Truth</a> spell without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this feature, creatures who succeed on their saving throw take 1d4 psychic damage at the start of each of their turns while they remain within the affected area.

<h2>Apocalyptic Revelation</h2>
At 20th level, as an action you can reveal the true nature of your enemies to all for 1 minute. During this time, you gain the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>You have truesight out to a distance of 120 feet.</li>
    <li>Creatures who start their turn, or move within, 5 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw against your paladin spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is blinded until the start of its next turn.</li>
    <li>As a bonus action on each of your turns you can choose a creature within 60 feet and reveal its weaknesses for all to see. Attacks made against the chosen creature have advantage until the start of your next turn.</li>
</ul>

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
