        <h1>Oath of the Unbreakable</h1>
        Unbreakable Paladins are soldiers who dedicate themselves to defending the ideals of freedom and prosperity and fighting those who would use strength and violence to subdue and rule the weak. Commonly called bulwark knights, mountain knights, and The Unbroken, these soldiers stride into battle with defensive magics alight, making them mobile fortresses that can withstand the wrath of kings, emperors, and gods.

<h2>Adamantine Bulwark</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as a reaction, anytime you take damage from an attack or spell you may reduce all damage dealt by an amount equal to your paladin level.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Unstoppable Tilt</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you may spend an action to use your Channel Divinity in order to make an unstoppable charge. You may move up to twice your speed in a straight line. You can move through enemy creatures, and the first enemy creature you come into contact with must make a Strength saving throw equal to 8 + your proficiency + your Strength modifier, or they take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and are forcefully moved with you until you finish your charge, or take no damage and are knocked prone. All other creatures you, or the creature you are carrying, pass through after the first must also make the save or be knocked prone.
<h2>Aura of Iron</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you reduce all damage by an amount equal to your spell casting ability modifier (minimum 1).<br><br>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
<h2>Living Bulwark</h2>
Beginning at 15th level, you can no longer be restrained or forcefully moved. Allies may also use you to gain the benefits of 3/4's cover.
<h2>Armor of the Gods</h2>
At 20th level, as an action, you can create an additional layer of armor made of solidified arcane energy over your existing armor. For the next minute, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>If an attack or spell does less than 15 damage to you, you ignore it.</li>
<li>Anytime a creature makes a ranged attack against a creature within your Aura of Iron, roll a d6. On a 4, 5, or 6, the attack is made against you instead.</li>
<li>Creatures of your choice within your aura always gain the benefits of half cover.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
