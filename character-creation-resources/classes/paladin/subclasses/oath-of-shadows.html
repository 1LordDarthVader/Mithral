        <h1>Oath of Shadows</h1>
        The Oath of Shadows is a pledge to serve as the weapon of a dark patron that eschews the light of day. It is said the first paladins to swear this Oath swore it to the night itself, to defend night travelers from those that would prey on them.<br><br>
Paladins of Shadows universally wear shades of brown, grey, and black, and are equally at home in leathers as they are in plate. Always a foreboding sight, paladins of this Oath sometimes find themselves the target of fear, suspicion, and prejudice from those afraid of who, or what they represent.

<h2>Night Cloak</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as an action you present a holy symbol and begin concentrating, weaving your power around you to hide yourself from view. For up to 1 hour or until you break concentration, attack, or cast a spell, you are invisible, inaudible, and your armor does not give you disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. You are also silent and incapable of speaking for the duration.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Ghostly Blade</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you may also use your Channel Divinity, empowering your weapon with dreadful shadow. If you do, the target and each other creature of your choice within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn, and all damage that you deal in this attack becomes either psychic or necrotic damage (your choice).
<h2>Midnight Blessing</h2>
Beginning at 7th level, the darkness grants you a boon, which you may pass on to those around you. For you and creatures you choose within 10 feet of you, armor does not impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and creatures within this radius gain darkvision out to 60 feet. If they already have darkvision, they increase their current darkvision by 60 feet. Further, any affected creature within the radius may telepathically send a message that can be heard only by other affected creatures within the radius.<br><br>
At 18th level, the radius of this ability increases to 30 feet.
<h2>Umbral Jaunt</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you can slide through darkness to strike in retribution at those who threaten your allies. When a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack against you or a creature friendly to you, you may use your reaction to teleport yourself through your shadow to a point within 5 feet of the attacking creature. You may then make one attack against the creature, resolving it after the creature resolves its attacks. You can teleport up to 60 feet if the attacking creature is standing in an area of dim light or darkness.<br><br>
Once you use this ability, you require a short or long rest to use it again.
<h2>Living Nightmare</h2>
At 20th level, you grow ever closer to becoming one with the night. As an action on your turn, you can allow the shadow energy within you to overtake your physical form, turning you into a shifting, pitch dark humanoid horror. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Your attacks deal an additional 1d8 psychic damage, and a creature hit by one or more of your attacks on your turn must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</li>
<li>You are invisible to all creatures except the creature you have most recently attacked. This invisibility persists even after you attack or cast a spell.</li>
<li>You can move through a space as narrow as one inch in diameter without squeezing.</li>
<li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons that are not silver.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
