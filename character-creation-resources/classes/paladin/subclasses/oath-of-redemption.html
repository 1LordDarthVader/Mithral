        <h1>Oath of Redemption</h1>
        The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning them to the light, and the paladins slay them only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.<br><br>
While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, the paladins bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.

<h2>Emissary of Peace</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, when you speak, you are listened to. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for checks made with it.<br><br>
Additionally, if a creature can understand at least one language, they can understand your speech, regardless of whether you share a language.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Rebuke the Violent</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to rebuke those who use violence. Immediately after an attacker within 30 feet of you deals damage with an attack against a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to the damage it just dealt. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.
<h2>Protector's Strike</h2>
<em>Optional Feature, replaces Extra Attack</em><br />
Starting at 5th level, you can punish those who attack your allies. When a creature within 5 feet of you other than you is attacked, if the attacker is within your reach, you can use your reaction to make a single melee weapon attack against them.
<h2>Aura of the Guardian</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you can shield your allies from harm at the cost of your own health. When a creature within 10 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to magically take that damage, instead of that creature taking it. This feature doesn't transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage can't be reduced in any way.<br><br>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
<h2>Protective Spirit</h2>
Starting at 15th level, a holy presence mends your wounds in combat. You regain hit points equal to 1d6 + half your paladin level if you end your turn in combat with fewer than half of your hit points remaining and you aren't incapacitated.
<h2>Emissary of Redemption</h2>
At 20th level, you become an avatar of peace, which gives you the following benefits.
<ul>
<li>You have resistance to all damage dealt by other creatures (their attacks, spells, and other effects).</li>
<li>Whenever a creature damages you, it takes radiant damage equal to half the amount it dealt to you.</li>
</ul>
If you attack a creature, cast a spell on it, or deal damage to it by any means but this feature or your Rebuke the Violent or Protector's Strike features, neither benefit works against that creature until you finish a long rest.
