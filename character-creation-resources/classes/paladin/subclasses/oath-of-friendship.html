        <h1>Oath of Friendship</h1>
        Paladins take on many types of oaths, and not always towards a king or higher power. Some choose to be loyal to the people around them instead, swearing to uphold the force that binds people together in friendship. Those sworn to the Oath of Friendship dedicate themselves to their relationships, friendships, and even lifelong rivalries. These knights understand that sometimes the strongest thing one can do is ask for help. Transcending race and creed, the Oath of Friendship can be upheld as long as people are willing to stand by each other's side.

<h2>Help From Friends</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as an action, you speak a message of unity in a loud voice. A creature of your choice within 30 feet of you is considered to be aided by the Help action from an unseen source for a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1).<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy</h2>
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.<br><br>
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
<h2>Supportive Presence</h2>
At 7th level, when you use your Lay on Hands feature, you can target a creature up to 10 feet away from you. You can cure the charmed and frightened conditions in addition to diseases and poisons by spending 5 hit points from your pool. The range of this ability increases to 30 feet when you reach 18th level in this class.
<h2>Unwavering Loyalty</h2>
Starting at 15th level, if you would drop to zero hit points while at least one allied creature is within 60 feet, you can make a Charisma saving throw with a DC equal to the amount of damage taken over your current hit points. On success, you instead drop to 1 hit point.<br><br>
Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. The DC resets when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Best of Friends</h2>
At 20th level, whenever an allied creature makes an attack against a creature, you can use your reaction to take the Help action, granting them advantage on the attack.<br><br>
If an allied creature is reduced to 0 hit points by another creature, you can use your reaction to move up to your movement speed towards them and make an attack against that creature. On this attack, you can use your Divine Smite feature at its lowest level without expending a spell slot.
