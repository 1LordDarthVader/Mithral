        <h1>Oath of the Open Sea</h1>
        The Oath of the Open Sea calls to sea-faring warriors, swashbuckling sailors, and journeying guardians who seek the thrill of an endless horizon. Driven to seek the adventure and mystery across and beneath every endless oceanic expanse, paladins who swear this oath stand against those who would deny the liberties afforded to likeminded travelers, rooting out the tyrannical and corrupt that claim any shore. Such guardians believe in the natural beauty of the sea, often making offerings and prayers to entities or deities like the Wild Mother or Storm Lord that influence safe passage, while often feeling called to hunt those monstrosities that seek to terrorize and spoil the waters with wanton violence and ill intent.

<h2>Marine Layer</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as an action you can channel the sea to create a thick cloud of fog that surrounds you and heavily obscures the area for 20 feet in all directions, following you as you move. You and all creatures within 5 feet of you instead treat this fog as lightly obscured. This fog lasts for 10 minutes, spreads around corners and cannot be dispersed.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Fury of the Tides</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can expend your Channel Divinity to channel the powerful might of the waves to bolster your attacks for 1 minute. Once per turn for the duration, when you hit a creature with weapon attack, you can choose to push the target 10 feet away from you. If the target is pushed into an obstacle or another creature, they take additional bludgeoning damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
<h2>Aura of Liberation</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you emanate an aura while you're not incapacitated. You and any creature of your choice within 10 feet of you cannot be grappled or restrained, as well as ignore penalties on movement or attacks while underwater. Creatures that are already grappled or restrained when they enter the aura can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape nonmagical restraints.<br><br>
When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of the aura increases to 30 feet.
<h2>Stormy Waters</h2>
At 15th level, you can call crashing waters around you as a reaction whenever a creature enters or exits your melee range. The creature takes 1d12 bludgeoning damage and must succeed a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
<h2>Mythic Swashbuckler</h2>
At 20th level, you learn to channel the spirits of historic sea captains to briefly become a paragon of heroic adventure. As an action, you embrace these spirits of the sea, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:
<ul>
<li>Climbing costs no additional movement, and you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks.</li>
<li>If you are within 5 feet of a creature, and no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, you have advantage on your attacks against that creature.</li>
<li>You can take the Dodge action as a bonus action.</li>
<li>You have advantage on all Dexterity ability checks and Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
