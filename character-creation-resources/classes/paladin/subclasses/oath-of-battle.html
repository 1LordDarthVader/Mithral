        <h1>Oath of Battle</h1>
        While all paladins are, in one respect or another, the faith militant of their respective traditions, those who swear the Oath of Battle place themselves at the forefront of armed conflict. Crusaders of their faith, paladins that swear this Oath are often born leaders-chieftains, warlords, jarls, and khans-who stand resolute against all aggressors. More than just good in a fight, paladins who swear the Oath of Battle are champions of their people, and their presence inspires their allies to go that extra mile when weapons clash.

<h2>Stand and Fight</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as an action, you can imbue yourself with strength in the ways of the knight. For 1 minute, or until you fall unconscious, you add your spellcasting ability modifier to all your Strength ability checks.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Hit and Run</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as an action, you can imbue yourself with agility in the ways of the skirmisher using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, or until you fall unconscious, your movement speed increases by a number of feet equal to 5 x your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 5 feet), your reach increases by 5 feet, and opportunity attacks targeting you are made at disadvantage.
<h2>Aura of Action</h2>
Beginning at 7th level, your invigorating presence propels your cause forward. While you are conscious, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you add your spellcasting ability modifier to initiative checks (minimum of 1).<br><br>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
<h2>Lead the Ranks</h2>
Starting at 15th level, you go gallantly and willingly to the front lines, placing yourself in danger to stir the hearts and minds of your companions and make your foes falter. When you succeed on a saving throw while under the effects of a Channel Divinity or your Stand and Fight feature, you and friendly creatures within 30 feet of you gain temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and hostile creatures within 30 feet take radiant damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1).
<h2>Exalted Warrior</h2>
Starting at 20th level, as an action, you transform for 1 minute into the perfect avatar of battle told of in stories. For 1 minute, you gain the effects of both your Channel Divinity options, along with the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Your size becomes Large, unless you were larger.</li>
<li>You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that.</li>
<li>Each of your ability scores becomes 22, unless it was already higher.</li>
</ul>
After taking this action, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
