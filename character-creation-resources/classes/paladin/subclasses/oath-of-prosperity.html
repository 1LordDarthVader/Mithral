        <h1>Oath of Prosperity</h1>
        Wealth is the availability of goods and services, and thus is a representation of both power and opportunity. A wealthy benefactor can save a civilization, while a wealthy tyrant can turn the world on its head. The Oath of Prosperity merges the spiritual with the materialistic, benevolence with self-interest, and temperance with a hunger for power. Through these seemingly opposites, you've sworn to let nothing stand between you and the accumulation of wealth, as any goal you have can be accomplished with the prudent use of overwhelming financial might.

<h2>Hired Help</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, as an action, you can summon a simple magical construct for 1 hour. This construct has the statistics of a commoner, though it is a construct instead of its normal type. It cannot attack, cast spells, or activate magic items. If it dies or the duration expires, it fades into mist.
<h2>Channel Divinity: Golden Suit</h2>
As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to coat yourself in shining gold for 1 hour. You gain temporary hit points equal to twice your paladin level for the duration. Whenever a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, gold sprays off your armor, causing the creature to suffer disadvantage on their first attack before the end of their next turn.
<h2>Aura of Investment</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you are surrounded by a 10-foot aura of mutual benefit. You and all friendly creatures within 10 feet of you gain temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1) at the start of each of your turns.<br><br>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.
<h2>Hand of Greed</h2>
Starting at 15th level, once per turn when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can attempt to steal an object or weapon from the target. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your paladin spell save DC or lose the chosen item. If you lack a free hand to steal the item, the attempt automatically fails.
<h2>Platinum Idol</h2>
At 20th level, you call upon the debts that you are owed and empower yourself. For 1 minute, the rustling of your armor sounds strangely like the clinking of coins. You gain the following benefits.
<ul>
<li>You gain 20 temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns that last for the duration of this feature.</li>
<li>Whenever you steal a weapon using your Hand of Greed feature, you can immediately make a weapon attack using it. This does not require an action.</li>
<li>When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can choose to unleash a blast of golden light. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your paladin spell save DC. If they fail, they are blinded until the end of your next turn.</li>
</ul>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
