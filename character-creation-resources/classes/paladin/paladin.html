<h1>Paladin</h1>

Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful bond.

<h2>Class Features</h2>

As a paladin, you gain the following class features.

<h3>Hit Points</h3>
<strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per paladin level<br>
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier<br>
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per paladin level after 1st

<h3>Proficiencies</h3>
<strong>Armor:</strong> All armor, shields<br>
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br>
<strong>Tools:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wisdom, Charisma<br>
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>(a) a martial weapon and any shield (not including tower shields) or (b) two martial weapons</li>
    <li>(a) five javelins or (b) a simple melee weapon</li>
    <li>(a) chain mail or (b) leather armor</li>
    <li>an equipment pack and a holy symbol</li>
</ul>

<h3>Divine Sense</h3>
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.
<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

<h3>Arcane Sense</h3>
Optional Feature, replaces Divine Sense<br>
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any aberration, elemental, or fey within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (aberration, elemental, or fey) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.
<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

<h3>Lay on Hands</h3>
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.
<br><br>
As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. When used on yourself, you can use this feature as a bonus action, rather than as an action.
<br><br>
Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.
<br><br>
This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

<h3>Sunlight Orb</h3>
Optional Feature, replaces Lay on Hands<br>
You can use your action to hurl a magical ball of searing radiance that explodes at a point you can see within 120 feet of you.  Each creature within a 5-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.  The sphere spreads around corners.  A creature takes 1d6 fire and 1d6 radiant damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.

<br><br>You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.  This feature deals more damage and has a greater area of effect when you reach certain paladin levels, as described in the table below.

<h3>Hellfire Orb</h3>
Optional Feature, replaces Lay on Hands<br>
You can use your action to hurl a magical ball of blazing fire that explodes at a point you can see within 120 feet of you.  Each creature within a 5-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.  The sphere spreads around corners.  A creature takes 1d6 fire and 1d6 necrotic damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.

<br><br>You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.  This feature deals more damage and has a greater area of effect when you reach certain paladin levels, in the same way as Sunlight Orb.

<h3>Arcane Orb</h3>
Optional Feature, replaces Lay on Hands<br>
You can use your action to hurl a magical ball of arcane flame that explodes at a point you can see within 120 feet of you.  Each creature within a 5-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.  The sphere spreads around corners.  A creature takes 1d6 fire and 1d6 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.

<br><br>You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.  This feature deals more damage and has a greater area of effect when you reach certain paladin levels, in the same way as Sunlight Orb.

<h3>Fighting Style</h3>
Starting at 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

<h4>Blessed Warrior</h4>
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the
<a href="../../spells/classes/cleric.html">cleric spell list</a>. They count as paladin spells for you. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the cleric spell list.

<h4>Blind Fighting</h4>
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

<h4>Defensive Fighting</h4>
While wearing armor or wielding a shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

<h4>Great Weapon Fighting</h4>
When you roll a 1 or 2 on the damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the damage, though you must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.
<br><br>
The weapon must have the heavy, versatile, or two-handed property to gain this benefit.

<h4>Heavyweight Fighting</h4>
You use your weight, and that of your weapon, to land devastating blows. While you are wielding a heavy weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls and you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to Shove.

<h4>Interception</h4>
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

<h4>Mounted Warrior</h4>
Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee attack while riding a mount, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw against your Exploit save DC. On a failed save, a Large or smaller target is knocked prone.

<h4>Protection</h4>
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a melee weapon or a shield to use this reaction.

<h4>Shield Fighting</h4>
If you are wielding a shield and no other weapons, you gain a +1 bonus to both your damage rolls with shield attacks, and to your Armor Class.

<h4>Standard Bearer</h4>
When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a creature that you can see, you can grant them advantage on their attack roll as a reaction. You must be carrying a banner, flag, or standard in your hand to use this reaction.

<h4>Unarmed Fighting</h4>
Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
<br><br>
At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.

<h3>Spellcasting</h3>
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.

<h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
<br><br>
You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the
<a href="../../spells/classes/paladin.html">paladin spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
<br><br>
You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.
<br><br>
<strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier<br>
<strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier

<h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.

<h3>Divine Smite</h3>
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal extra radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.

<h3>Profane Smite</h3>
Optional Feature, replaces Divine Smite<br>
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal extra necrotic damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is a fey or a celestial.

<h3>Arcane Smite</h3>
Optional Feature, replaces Divine Smite<br>
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal extra force damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an aberration or an elemental.

<h3>Divine Health</h3>
By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease. In addition, you cannot become drunk.

<h3>Sacred Oath</h3>
When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

</ul>

<h4>Oath Spells</h4>
Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
<br><br>
If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.

<h4>Channel Divinity</h4>
Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.
<br><br>
When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
<br><br>
Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.

<h3>Harness Divine Power</h3>
Also at 3rd level, you can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 3rd level, once; 7th level, twice; and 15th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

<h3>Martial Versatility</h3>
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to paladins. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.

<h3>Extra Attack</h3>
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

<h3>Aura of Protection</h3>
Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.
<br><br>
At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

<h3>Aura of Courage</h3>

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

<h3>Improved Smite</h3>
By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage. This damage is the same type as your Smite feature.

<h3>Cleansing Touch</h3>
Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.
