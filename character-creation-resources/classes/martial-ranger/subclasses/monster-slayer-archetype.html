        <h1>Monster Slayer Archetype</h1>
        You have dedicated yourself to hunting down creatures of the night and wielders of grim magic. A monster slayer seeks out vampires, dragons, evil fey, fiends, and other magical threats. Trained to resist such monsters' supernatural powers, slayers are experts at unearthing and defeating mighty, mystical foes.
<h2>Monster Expert</h2>
You have an encyclopedic knowledge of all things strange and supernatural. At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana and Religion skills, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for one of these skills (your choice).
<h2>Slayer's Insight</h2>
At 3rd level, your eye is keenly trained on how best to hurt even the most exotic of creatures. When you use Hunter's Prey to mark a creature you can see within 60 feet of you, you can make an Intelligence skill check: Nature, Arcana, etc. depending on the creature type (DC equals 10 + half the target's CR). If you succeed, you immediately learn whether the creature has any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are, as well as condition immunities. You also deal an additional 1d8 damage on your first weapon attack to hit that creature, and others with the same name, each turn until your next long rest.
<h2>Iron Mind</h2>
By 7th level, you have honed your ability to resist the mind-altering powers of your quarry. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).
<h2>Magic-User's Nemesis</h2>
At 11th level, you gain the ability to thwart someone else's magic. When you see a creature casting a spell or teleporting within range of a weapon you are holding, you can use your reaction to make an attack against that creature with that weapon. If this attack is a critical hit, the spell or teleport fails and is wasted.
<h2>Slayer's Counter</h2>
At 15th level, you gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. If your prey forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against them, provided they are within range of a weapon you are holding. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If the attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack's normal effects.
