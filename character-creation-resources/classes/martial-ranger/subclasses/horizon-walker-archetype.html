        <h1>Horizon Walker Archetype</h1>
        You are first and foremost an explorer, never satisfied staying long in the same place, always seeking new experiences and challenges - even those beyond your world.
<h2>Adaptive Adventurer</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you are able to adapt to new environments incredibly quickly. As a bonus action, you can change your favored terrain to any terrain type you have spent at least one day in, replacing an existing favored terrain.<br><br>
You can also use your bonus action to change your favored enemy to any type of creature you have fought and marked as your prey with the Hunter's Prey feature within the last day, replacing an existing favored enemy.<br><br>
You regain use of each feature after completing a long rest.
<h2>Exploit Weakness</h2>
You quickly become familiar with certain enemies' weak spots. At 3rd level, once per turn, you deal an additional 1d8 damage when you hit a favored enemy.
<h2>Planar Wanderer</h2>
At 7th level, you can even adapt to otherworldly environments. You gain an additional favored terrain, which does not count against your maximum, and access to planar terrain types: Upper Planes, Lower Planes, Feywild, Shadowfell, Mechanus, Limbo and the Elemental Chaos. As usual, you must have spent at least one day in one of these terrain types before designating it as your favored terrain.<br><br>
The Natural Healer DC for all planar terrains is 25.<br><br>
When you gain the Favored Terrain Master feature at 9th level, add the following to the list of potential benefits:
<ul>
<li><strong>Elemental Chaos.</strong> You gain resistance to one of the following damage types of your choice: fire, cold, lightning or non-magical bludgeoning.</li>
<li><strong>Feywild.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed.</li>
<li><strong>Limbo.</strong> You gain resistance to psychic damage.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Planes.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanus.</strong> You gain proficiency with tinker's tools and thieves' tools, and have advantage on ability checks made with these tool kits.</li>
<li><strong>Shadowfell.</strong> You gain resistance to necrotic damage.</li>
<li><strong>Upper Planes.</strong> You gain resistance to radiant damage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Planar Step</h2>
You learn to briefly shift through interplanar space. Starting at 7th level, you can cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=523">Misty Step</a> spell once, and regain use of this feature when you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Slayer</h2>
At 11th level, you may make an additional weapon attack when you take the Attack action against a favored enemy.
<h2>Key to the Cosmos</h2>
At 15th level, your planar travels have caused your soul to become attuned to the weave between worlds. You can cast misty step twice per short rest instead of once; additionally, you can cast <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=208">Dimension Door</a> once per long rest, and either teleport or plane shift once every seven long rests. You still need to provide all necessary spell components.
