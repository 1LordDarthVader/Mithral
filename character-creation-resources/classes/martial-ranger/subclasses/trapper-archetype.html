        <h1>Trapper Archetype</h1>
        Some rangers prefer to let their quarry come to them, setting cunning traps for unsuspecting prey. Trappers use snares not only to catch prey, but also to track them, and to alert themselves to approaching danger. Skilled trappers can even rig together a half-readied snare in combat, turning a simple melee into a minefield.
<h2>Snarecrafter</h2>
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with tinker's tools, and you learn to craft two snares of your choice from the Basic Snares list. You learn two more Basic Snares at 7th level.<br><br>
A snare is built within a single 5-foot square. Once constructed, it can't be moved without destroying or triggering the snare.<br><br>
Crafting a snare takes one minute and requires you to be holding tinker's tools in both hands. You can have a number of snares crafted at one time equal to your proficiency bonus.<br><br>
Your snare DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. All saving throws and checks triggered by snares use your snare DC. You can choose whether the snare is visible or hidden; if you choose hidden, a creature must succeed on a Perception or Investigation check against your snare DC to find it.
<h3>Basic Snares</h3>
<h4>Alarm Snare</h4>
You create an alarm snare by rigging one or more noisy objects to a trip wire or pressure plate. When a Small or larger creature enters the square, the snare makes a noise loud enough that it can be heard by all creatures within 200 feet.
<h4>Hampering Snare</h4>
You arrange brambles, wires, sticky goo, or other materials to interfere with a creature's movement. A five-foot radius circle of difficult terrain forms when this snare is triggered. A creature can use its action to clear the difficult terrain from one five-foot square they are standing on or adjacent to.
<h4>Hobbling Snare</h4>
You rig vines, ropes, or wires to cinch tight around a creature that triggers this snare. It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have its speed halved for 1 minute, or until it uses an action to untangle itself.
<h4>Marking Snare</h4>
A snare used to track or identify. On a failed Dexterity saving throw it marks the triggering creature with a sticky dye or scent marker, ranging from a small mark to a bucket of paint. The creature is marked for 24 hours or until it washes itself for ten minutes.
<h4>Signaling Snare</h4>
A subtle snare that does not reveal itself when triggered or affect the triggering creature, but instead causes a small disruption to the terrain that can be used for tracking.
<h4>Spike Snare</h4>
This basic snare consists of hidden spikes that rely on a creature's momentum to lacerate or potentially impale it when it triggers the snare. The creature must attempt a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 piercing damage, or half that much on a successful save. The snare counts as difficult terrain.
<h4>Trip Snare</h4>
You set a cunning wire to trip a creature. A creature that triggers the snare must make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone until its next turn. The snare counts as difficult terrain, even on a success.
<h2>Trap Finder</h2>
Your expertise in making traps makes them easy to spot for you. Starting at 3rd level, you have advantage on Perception or Investigation checks to find hidden traps.
<h2>Quick Snares</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you can rig a snare in only moments. You can craft snares that normally take 1 minute using one action. The snare is visible unless you use a bonus action to hide it, which requires a successful Stealth check against nearby enemies' passive Perception.
<h2>Ensnaring Weapons</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you can make an attack with a net as a bonus action. You also gain proficiency with the bolas, a ranged martial weapon (range 20/60) that deals 1d4 damage on a hit and costs 5 gp. A creature hit by a bolas must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained and knocked prone. Escape follows the same rules as for a net. The escape DC for both weapons becomes your snare DC.
<h2>Advanced Snarecrafter</h2>
At 11th level, you begin to experiment with more powerful and dangerous snares. You learn how to craft two snares from the Advanced Snares list. You cannot use Quick Snares with Advanced Snares.<br><br>
You can craft a number of Advanced Snares equal to your proficiency bonus, and can only produce more after completing a long rest.
<h3>Advanced Snares</h3>
<h4>Biting Snare</h4>
A snare whose jaws shut tight on the leg of a creature that steps on it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 piercing damage, or half as much on a successful save, and have its speed halved until it succeeds at an Athletics check to remove the snare.
<h4>Bomb Snare</h4>
An alchemical incendiary readied to blow. Upon this snare being triggered, every creature within a 10-foot radius must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 fire damage, or half as much on a success.
<h4>Poison Dart Snare</h4>
A pressure plate or tripwire triggers a volley of poison-tipped darts. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of the snare must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and 2d8 poison damage, and succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain the poisoned condition. It can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, and is no longer poisoned on a success. A creature that succeeds is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
<h4>Stunning Snare</h4>
A weight swings down to bash the triggering creature senseless. It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and be stunned until the end of its next turn.
<h2>Snare Master</h2>
At 15th level, double the number of snares you can have crafted at a single time. Once per turn, when you use the Attack action, you can craft a Basic Snare in place of one of your attacks, rather than using a full action.
