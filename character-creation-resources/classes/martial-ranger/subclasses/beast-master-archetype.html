        <h1>Beast Master Archetype</h1>
        The Beast Master archetype embodies friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast and ranger work as one to fight the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype means committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership with an animal as its companion and friend.
<h2>Ranger's Companion</h2>
        At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. It is able to understand simple speech and commands. The beast grows along with you, using your proficiency bonus (PB) as its own. The beast can be created using the <a href="../beast-companion.html">Beast Companion rules</a>. Choose traits that fit the type of creature you wish to bond with, or use one of the example stat blocks.<br><br>
In combat, the beast acts during your turn and moves at your command. It can use its reaction and bonus action (if applicable) on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can instead sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to use an Attack, Dash, Disengage or Help action. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.<br><br>
Like a player character, the beast becomes unconscious at 0 hit points and makes death saving throws. If the beast has died within the last hour, you can spend 10 minutes using a healing poultice to revive it with half the hit points normally provided by the healing poultice. You cannot revive the beast again in this way until you and your companion have completed a long rest.<br><br>
The beast also follows all resting rules that apply to player characters, including the ability to roll Hit Dice to regain hit points on a short rest.
<h2>Animal Whisperer</h2>
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Animal Handling. If you were already proficient in Animal Handling, double your proficiency bonus for any ability checks made using this skill.
<h2>Exceptional Training</h2>
Beginning at 7th level, your beast companion can use the Help action instead of the Dodge action on any turn in which you did not give it a command.
<h2>Bestial Fury</h2>
Starting at 11th level, when you command your beast companion to take the Attack action, the beast can make two attacks.
<h2>Share Prey</h2>
Beginning at 15th level, your beast companion shares the benefits of Hunter's Prey when attacking or tracking any creature you have marked as your prey.
