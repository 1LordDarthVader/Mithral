        <h1>Hunter Archetype</h1>
        The hunter is the most classic of ranger archetypes. Whether you stand as a self-sufficient outlander or as the bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wild, you excel in specialized techniques for taking down your prey.
<h2>Hunter's Eye</h2>
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Perception skill. If you were already proficient in Perception, double your proficiency bonus for any ability checks made using this skill.
<h2>Hunter's Quarry</h2>
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
<ul>
<li><strong>Colossus Slayer.</strong> Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.</li>
<li><strong>Giant Killer.</strong> When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.</li>
<li><strong>Horde Breaker.</strong> Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Defensive Tactics</h2>
At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
<ul>
<li><strong>Escape the Horde.</strong> Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.</li>
<li><strong>Multiattack Defense.</strong> When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.</li>
<li><strong>Steel Will.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Multiattack</h2>
At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
<ul>
<li><strong>Focused Barrage.</strong> When you only attack one creature on your turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as a bonus action.</li>
<li><strong>Hunter's Volley.</strong> Once per turn, when you make a ranged weapon attack, you can make one additional ranged weapon attack against a creature within 10 feet of your target. Additionally, you can apply your Hunter's Prey damage when you hit any creature within 10 feet of your prey with a ranged weapon attack, as long as you also attack your prey on that turn.</li>
<li><strong>Whirlwind Slice.</strong> Once per turn, when you make a melee weapon attack, you can use your momentum to sweep through multiple creatures. Make one additional melee weapon attack against every creature within 5 feet, aside from your original target.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Superior Hunter's Defense</h2>
At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
<ul>
<li><strong>Evasion.</strong> When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</li>
<li><strong>Stand Against the Tide.</strong> When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.</li>
<li><strong>Uncanny Dodge.</strong> When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.</li>
</ul>
