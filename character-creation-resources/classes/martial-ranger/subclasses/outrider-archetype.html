        <h1>Outrider Archetype</h1>
        Many rangers disdain the idea of riding an animal companion, but for some this is the ultimate expression of the bond between ranger and beast. Whether charging over a hillside or riding wild and free across the plains, outriders and their mounts fight and live as one.
<h2>Bonded Mount</h2>
        At 3rd level, you gain a Medium or Large beast companion, typically but not exclusively a horse. Use the <a href="../beast-companion.html">Beast Companion rules</a> to create it. The companion must not use the Light array or Flyer speed. Your companion is trained to understand and obey your commands and uses your proficiency bonus (PB).<br><br>
Your companion acts on your turn and moves at your command. It can use its reaction and bonus action (if applicable) on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you use a bonus action on your turn to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage or Help action; you must be mounted to command it in this way. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.<br><br>
Like a player character, the beast becomes unconscious at 0 hit points and makes death saving throws. If the beast has died within the last hour, you can spend 10 minutes using a healing poultice to revive it with half the hit points normally provided by the healing poultice. You cannot revive the beast again in this way until you and your companion have completed a long rest.<br><br>
The beast also follows all resting rules that apply to player characters, including the ability to roll Hit Dice to regain hit points on a short rest.
<h2>Born to Ride</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You gain proficiency with the Animal Handling skill, and you can double your proficiency bonus for this skill if you were already proficient. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you're not incapacitated.<br><br>
Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.
<h2>Ranger's Charge</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you use your mount's momentum to deadly effect. If your mount moves at least 20 feet uninterrupted while you are riding it and you take the Attack action, the first of your attacks to hit that turn deals an additional 1d8 damage.
<h2>Trampling Charge</h2>
Starting at 11th level, you can spur your mount to plow through whole groups of enemies. Use your action to command your mount to move in a straight line up to its speed. It can move through occupied spaces, which count as difficult terrain. All creatures in its path must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + its Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus) or take 6d6 bludgeoning damage, or half as much on a successful save. A Huge or larger enemy blocks the path of the charge but still takes damage. This movement does not trigger attacks of opportunity.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all uses after you and your mount complete a long rest.
<h2>Legendary Bond</h2>
At 15th level, the bond between you and your mount has grown so strong that you instinctively understand each other. Once per turn, you can command your mount to Attack, Dash, Disengage or Help as part of your action, instead of using your bonus action.
