        <h1>Warden Archetype</h1>
        All rangers have a deep connection to the wilderness, but wardens delve even further, into the realm of primal mysticism. Wardens are often trained by a druidic circle, in order to serve as the first line of defense between the civilized world and the mysteries of the wild.

<h2>Spellcasting</h2>
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
You learn three cantrips: druid spell list. You learn another druid cantrip of your choice at 10th level. These cantrips become warden spells for you.
<h3>Spell Slots</h3>
The Warden Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br><br>
<h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
        You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the <a href="../../../spells/classes/druid.html">druid spell list</a> or <a href="../../../spells/classes/ranger.html">ranger spell list</a>, two of which must be from the transmutation or conjuration schools. These spells become warden spells for you.<br><br>
The Spells Known column of the Warden Spellcasting table shows when you learn more druid or ranger spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a transmutation or conjuration spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.<br><br>
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you know with another spell of your choice from the druid or ranger spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a transmutation or conjuration spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your warden spells, since they are derived from your instinctive connection to primal magic.
<br><br>
        <strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier<br />
<strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your warden spells.
<h2>Druidic Warrior</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, when you cast <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=671">Shillelagh</a>, you can target up to two quarterstaves or clubs that you are holding. The duration of the spell increases to 1 hour. If you are holding a quarterstaff affected by shillelagh in two hands, the damage die increases to a d12.<br><br>
In addition, when you hit your marked prey with a spell attack roll from a warden spell, add your Hunter's Prey damage as you would with a weapon attack.
<h2>Primeval Awareness</h2>
Beginning at 7th level, you can use your action to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, undead, and your favored enemy if it's not already on the list; how many there are; and roughly how close they are, though not their exact location.<br><br>
In addition, you learn beast sense, and can cast either without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Vanish</h2>
Starting at 11th level, you can draw on the powers of nature to hide yourself from view briefly. As a bonus action, you can magically become invisible, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, for 1 minute in non-natural terrain, 10 minutes in natural terrain, or one hour in your favored terrain. The effect ends if you take damage or make an attack.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Primal Communion</h2>
Beginning at 15th level, you learn commune with nature, and you can cast each one once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast one of these spells with this feature, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.
