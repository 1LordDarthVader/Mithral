        <h1>Herbalist Archetype</h1>
        Herbalists are masters of foraging, able to quickly spot and identify useful plants and craft potent medicines from them.
<h2>Forager</h2>
At 3rd level, you halve the time needed to find herbs using Natural Healer to thirty minutes per day, and the Natural Healer DC of all terrain types is decreased for you by 5. The number of healing poultices you can produce per day increases to 2 + your Wisdom modifier, or half that number on a failed Survival check (rounded down).
<h2>Herbal Adept</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, add your Wisdom modifier to the healing provided by healing poultices you produce. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any skill check you make with an herbalist's kit, and you have proficiency in the Medicine skill if you did not already. If you were already proficient, double your proficiency bonus when you make a Medicine check.
<h2>Resilient Constitution</h2>
At 7th level, your experience surviving on wild forage in the wilderness has made you hardy. You gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws, and have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.
<h2>Poisoner</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you can use your herbalism kit to craft poisons, as though it were a poisoner's kit.
<h2>Combat Healer</h2>
You can heal and fight almost simultaneously. Starting at 11th level, when you use your action to apply a healing poultice, you can make one weapon attack as part of the same action.
<h2>Herbal Master</h2>
Your medicines have become more advanced and versatile, even soothing the mind as well as the body. Starting at 15th level, if your healing poultices are applied to a creature that is poisoned, paralyzed, blinded, deafened, frightened or charmed, any and all of those conditions immediately end on that creature.
