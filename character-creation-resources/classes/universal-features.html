<h1>Universal Features</h1>

<h2>Extra Feat</h2>
Starting at 1st level, and again at 4th level, you gain additional skill in one aspect of adventuring. You gain one feat of your choice.

<h2>Genius</h2>
Starting at 1st level, and again at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th levels, you can apply your intelligence to every situation. You gain a number of Genius points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 0). If you have any levels in the Mystic or Savant classes, are a Blood Hunter or Mentor who uses Intelligence as their primary ability, or are a spellcaster who uses Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, you gain half as many points as you otherwise would.
<br><br>
Whenever you gain a level, you can spend Genius points to gain the following benefits of your choice.

<h2>Grit</h2>
Starting at 5th level, you can push on where others would falter, but at the cost of your own life. When you drop to 0 hit points but are not killed outright, at any time before the start of your next turn, you may declare Grit.
<br><br>
For the next minute, you remain conscious regardless of what affects you. No healing will work on you during this time. After this minute elapses, you die.
<br><br>
Starting at 11th level, if you would be killed outright, you may instead immediately declare Grit.
