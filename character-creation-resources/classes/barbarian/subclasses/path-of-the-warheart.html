        <h1>Path of the Warheart</h1>
        Warhearts are warriors who have seen the horrors of war and display the scars that those horrors have dealt to them. But beneath those scars lies a much more dangerous power. These warriors are half-sparks, individuals with extreme magical talents in one specific area: and their talent is battle.<br><br>
Inside their body is a potent yet latent primal magic that seeps out of them like sweat when they are in the thick of a fight. And as they fight, this magic gives them strength, power and endurance like no other, making them a more and more dangerous opponent every second the fight lasts.
<h2>Warheart's Fury</h2>
At 3rd level, when you pick this path, you gain a series of latent magics, called states, that becomes active when certain conditions are met while you are in combat. These states enhance your physical capabilities beyond your normal capacity, but can only become active while you are raging.<br><br>
If your rage ends early, and you have active states, you can attempt to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save the states do not end, but are instead inert until you re-enter your rage or a minute has passed.
<ul>
<li><strong>Avenger's Fury.</strong> If an ally you can see within 30 ft of you is knocked unconscious, you gain advantage on all attacks rolls made against the creature that dealt the damage to them.</li>
<li><strong>Killer's Momentum.</strong> If you kill a creature with a melee attack, you add your rage damage twice when you deal damage with a melee weapon attack. You can only have one instance of this state active, even if you kill multiple creatures.</li>
<li><strong>Slayer's Rush.</strong> If you hit with an attack that is a critical hit, or are hit by critical hit, your weapon attacks now score a critical hit on a 19-20. A second critical, given or received, causes you to score critical hits on an 18-20.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Warheart's Armor</h2>
At 6th level, you gain access to states that your allow your body to withstand great punishment. You also have advantage on the constitution save to not lose your active states when your rage ends early.
<ul>
<li><strong>Conqueror's Resilience.</strong> If you take damage of a type you are not resistant to, you gain resistance to that type of damage after the damage is taken. Every damage type you gain resistance to creates an additional version of this state.</li>
<li><strong>Demon's Frenzy.</strong> So long as you have of half your maximum hit points, rounded up, or less, you cannot be restrained, stunned, or paralyzed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bloodletter's Inspiration</h2>
At 10th level your power in combat can inspire your allies to greater heights. Whenever an allied creature starts its turn within 10ft of you, you can have them gain the benefits of one of your active states until the start of your next turn.
<h2>Wargod's Endurance</h2>
At 14th level, you have become strong enough to challenge the mightiest of foes. You gain a bonus to all saving throws equal to the number of active states you have (maximum of +5)
