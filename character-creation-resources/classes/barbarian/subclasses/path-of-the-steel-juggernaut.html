        <h1>Path of the Steel Juggernaut</h1>
        Barbarians clad in heavy steel armor are imposing figures on the battlefield, their incredible strength and durability felling entire armies single-handedly. These mighty few are barbarians who follow the Path of the Steel Juggernaut.
<h2>Iron Berserker</h2>
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you have learned to use the weight of heavy armor to benefit your raging combat.<br><br>
You gain proficiency with heavy armor, and you may rage while wearing heavy armor.<br><br>
In addition, if you are forcefully moved by any means, you may use your reaction to reduce the distance moved by an amount equal to your Strength score, rounding down to the nearest multiple of 5 feet (minimum of 5 feet reduction).
<h2>Sturdy</h2>
<em>Replaces Fast Movement</em><br />
Starting at 5th level, you are sturdier than most barbarians. You gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.
<h2>Steadfast</h2>
Starting at 7th level, you are hard to pin down in a fight. While standing, you have advantage on checks and saving throws against being grappled, restrained, knocked prone, or forcefully moved by any means.<br><br>
In addition, your armor cannot be removed against your will and cannot be damaged by nonmagical means.
<h2>Steel Bulwark</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you are an imposing figure on the battlefield, and many enemies prioritize attacking you. While raging, the area within 5 feet of you is considered difficult terrain, and creatures within 5 feet of you have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you.<br><br>
In addition, your armor is now immune to the effects of the heat metal spell.
<h2>Unstoppable Charge</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can perform a charging attack, during which nothing can hope to stop you. As an action, you can move up to three times your speed in a straight line, during which you can move through the space of creatures of your size or smaller.<br><br>
Creatures you move through the space of must succeed a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus) or take bludgeoning damage equal to your barbarian level and be pushed with you until the end of your charge. A creature that succeeds its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.<br><br>
You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.
