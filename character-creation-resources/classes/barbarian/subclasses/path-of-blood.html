        <h1>Path of Blood</h1>
        The Path of Blood is a path taken by only the most ruthless and battle-hungry barbarians. Perhaps it is the evil influence of a demon, devil, or a haunting ghost that drives them to delight in bloodshed. Perhaps they are attuned to the joyful brutality of the mad gods of war. These barbarians do not care when they shed their own blood-in fact, they use that energy to empower their rage even farther, using their suffering and sacrifice to inflict wounds upon their foes.
<h2>Bloodrage</h2>
Starting when you select this path at 3rd level, you can choose to ignite your blood with magical power during you rage. At the end of each of your turns while raging, you can choose to take 1d4 + half your barbarian level necrotic damage to release a burst of necrotic energy. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you takes necrotic damage equal to the necrotic damage you took, or twice as much if you have no more than half your hit points remaining. The necrotic damage you take cannot be reduced in any way.
<h2>Blood Rush</h2>
At 3rd level, on your turn while raging, you may use a bonus action to spend a hit die to heal yourself. If you choose to do so, roll the die, add your Constitution modifier, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1).
<h2>Scent of Death</h2>
At 6th level, you gain the ability to smell the scent of the injured from up to a mile away. You know scent's direction and the injured creature's type. Once you get within 1000 feet of the source, you can make a Wisdom (Perception) check against the creature's Dexterity (Stealth) check to pinpoint its location and identity. On a success, while you remain within 1000 feet, you know the exact distance and direction to the injured creature, the severity of its injury, and you determine its identity if you have encountered the creature before. On a failure, you cannot attempt this check again on the same scent for 1 hour.
<h2>Red in Tooth and Claw</h2>
At 10th level your body takes on a demonic change as your affinity for blood grows stronger. Your teeth lengthen into ghoulish fangs and you grow retractable talons on your fingers and toes. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks made against creatures that can see you, and your unarmed strikes become natural weapons that you are proficient with which deals 1d8 + your Strength modifier slashing or piercing damage (your choice) on a hit.<br><br>
Additionally, you can survive on meals made of rotting meat, blood or old bones and suffer no ill effects, including diseases or poisons.
<h2>Blood Drinker</h2>
Beginning at 14th level, whenever a creature within 10 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points while you're raging, you can bolster yourself with their spilled blood using a reaction. You regain a number of hit points equal to twice your Constitution modifier, and you can move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks and make a single melee weapon attack as part of the same reaction.
