        <h1>Path of the Battle Mage</h1>
        There are a few out there that have found the way to channel their rage and enhance their prowess in battle with arcane powers. These rare individuals are known as Battle Mages, barbarians who fight with their fury and magic. Battle Mages focus on spells from the evocation and transmutation schools.

<h2>Arcane Wellspring</h2>
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your rage with the ability to cast spells. Only spells and cantrips learned in this class can be cast while raging.
<h3>Cantrips</h3>
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the /arcane-spell-list">arcane spell list. You learn an additional arcane cantrip of your choice at 10th level.
<h3>Spell Points</h3>
You have a number of spell points at a given level, as shown in the Spell Points column of the Battle Mage Spellcasting table. In order to cast a spell, you must expend number of spell points determined by the level the spell is being cast at, as shown below:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Spell Level</th>
<th>Point Cost</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
</table>
You regain all expended spell points when you finish a long rest.
<h3>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h3>
You know one 1st level sorcerer spell of your choice, which must be of the evocation or transmutation schools. The Spells Known column of the Battle Mage Spellcasting table shows when you can learn more sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be equal to or lower than the maximum level of spells you can cast, as shown in the Max Spell Level column of the Battle Mage Spellcasting table.<br><br>
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.<br><br>
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the sorcerer spells you know with another spell of your choice from the arcane spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or transmutation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.
<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>
Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since your magic draws from your rage.
<strong>Spell Save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier<br />
<strong>Spell Attack Modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier
<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>
As you are a font of magic, you require no spellcasting focus, though you can use an arcane spellcasting focus if you wish to.
<h2>Battle Magic</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, learn you fuse your rage with your magic. You can now add your rage damage bonus to the damage of cantrips you cast.
<h2>Arcane Awareness</h2>
At 6th level, your magic enhances your danger senses to alert you of the presence of harmful magic. When you make a saving throw against a spell that deals damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw, and only half as much on a failed saving throw.
<h2>Improved Battle Magic</h2>
Beginning at 10th level, your magic permeates through your rage no matter the situation. You can now add your rage damage bonus to the damage of all spells you cast.
<h2>Relentless Battle Mage</h2>
Starting at 14th level, your fury and your magic become so intertwined with each other that they are inseparable. Your Brutal Critical feature now applies to your spells.<br><br>
In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, as a reaction you can make a melee spell attack against them, dealing force damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your rage damage bonus on a hit.
