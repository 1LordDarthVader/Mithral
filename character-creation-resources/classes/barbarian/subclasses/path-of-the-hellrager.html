        <h1>Path of the Hellrager</h1>
        Deep inside you is something not of this world. A dark ire that burns with all the intensity of hell itself. It calls to be let out, to be unchained. But you've come to control it. Mostly.<br><br>
You are a Hellrager that can enter a battle rage so ferocious that it causes others to easily mistake you for a horrid devil. The more you ight and kill, the deeper the rage gets, and the more of your mortal form peels away, till eventually you or no longer mortal, but cannot be considered a fiend.<br><br>
Whether is was forced upon you as a curse or your bloodline can be traced back to some hellish abomination, you don't hide that dark lame inside you as if it were something shameful. No, you use it as a weapon to kill your enemies and leave the survivors scarred with the memory of fighting a monster face to face.
<h2>True Form's Wrath</h2>
When you choose this path at 3rd level, the dark ire deep inside you causes your mortal form to slowly fall apart while you are raging, revealing what you truly are, or capable of becoming.<br><br>
While you are raging, each time you deal damage to an enemy creature, or suffer at least 5 points of damage, your mortal forms peels away a little and you gain one level on the hell form table and gain the benefit shown. You gain the first benefit of this table when you first enter into your rage.<br><br>
At 7th level, the damage that you need to suffer in order to gain a level on the hell form table increases to 7; then to 10 at 15th level. All damage needed to gain a level is calculated after resistances.<br><br>
Once you gain a benefit from the hell form table, you keep it until you finish a long rest where it resets. You only gain your hell form benefit while you are raging.

<h2>Impenetrable Fury</h2>
Starting at 6th level, if you are forced to make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, while raging, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on the roll. If you have the fiendish resilience benefit, then you can re-roll one of the dice once.
<h2>Scattering Charge</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can use a bonus action on your turn move up to your move speed to a point you can see. As you move, any creature that is within 10 feet of that point must make a wisdom saving throw equal to 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency modifier.<br><br>
On a failed save, a creature must use their reaction to move 10 feet away from that point. If they can't use their reaction, or have already used it, they are frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On a successful save they do not move and are not frightened of you. The DC increases by 1 if you have the baleful eyes benefit.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h2>Hellish Companions</h2>
Starting at 14th level, your rage is so intense that it can cause the fabric of reality to wear thin around you. While you are raging, you can choose to roll a d100 at the start of your turn. On a roll of 20 or lower, you summon a demon or devil of your choice with 30 feet of you.<br><br>
The CR of the summoned creature can be up to 5. The maximum CR increases to 6 if you have the baleful eyes benefits, then to 7 if you have the True form benefit.<br><br>
The summoned creature is not under your direct control and will act on its own accord. If it takes an action you don't like, you can use a bonus action on your turn to frighten it away from that course of action. It will disappear if you rage ends or you are outside of combat for at least one minute.
