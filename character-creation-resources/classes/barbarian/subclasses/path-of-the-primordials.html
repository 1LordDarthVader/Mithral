<h1>Path of the Primordials</h1>

Barbarians tap into primal powers, and a Barbarian of this path taps into one of the most ancient and primeval of them all. Those that walk the path of the primordials have learned to draw upon the fury of the elemental planes in the heat of battle, becoming one with the elemental chaos. Whether granted a boon of power by a primordial, suffused by the might of the elemental planes, or born with a fiery rage; whatever their origins, these barbarians can bend the very elements themselves to their will.

<h2>Ancient Tongues</h2>
When choosing this path at 3rd level, you learn to read and write Primordial, and you have advantage on Charisma checks when interacting with elemental creatures.

<h2>Elemental Affinity</h2>
At 3rd level, you gain magical benefits based on your preferred element. Choose one of the following elemental heritages. If you spend at least 30 minutes meditating during the course of a long rest, you can change your elemental affinity to a different element on the list.

<br>You learn a cantrip associated with your chosen heritage, which you can cast even while raging.

<br><br>In addition, your elemental affinity manifests when you enter a rage. While raging, your melee attacks gain the reach property, you gain resistance to your chosen element type, and your rage damage changes to that type.

<h2>Elements Unleashed</h2>
Starting at 6th level, once during a rage, you can unleash your rage into pure elemental energy and exhale a blast of elemental power as an action. Creatures within a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw with DC of 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Strength modifier. A creature takes 6d6 damage of the Element Type of your Elemental Affinity on a failed save.

<br><br>This damage increases by 2d6 at 9th level (8d6), 12th level (10d6), 15th level (12d6), and 18th level (14d6).

<h2>Primordial Resilience</h2>
Starting at 10th level, your primordial might grant you resistance to your Element Type and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources even when you are not raging.

<h2>One with the Elements</h2>
At 14th level, you have learned to unleash even more power from one of the elemental forces you wield. You gain additional benefits depending on your Elemental Affinity.

<br><br><strong>Air.</strong> Breathtaking wind whirls around you in a vortex. You have a flying speed of 30 feet, but you fall at the end of a turn if you are airborne and the only thing holding you aloft is your flying speed. For the duration of your rage, the area within a 10-foot radius of you is difficult terrain for hostile creatures, and ranged weapon attacks against you have disadvantage.
<br><br><strong>Earth.</strong> Your body becomes encased with a thick crust of elemental earth. You gain a burrowing speed of 30 feet, allowing you to pass through nonmagical earth and stone, leaving no hole behind you. If you would end your turn inside of earth or stone, you are pushed back to where you entered the earth or stone's surface. For the duration of your rage, your AC increases by 2 if you aren't wearing armor, and you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, stunned, forcefully moved, or knocked prone.
<br><br><strong>Fire.</strong> You can wreathe your body in a swirl of flame, burning any that would dare get close. Your movement speed is increased by 10 feet. For the duration of your rage, your rage damage becomes equal to your proficiency bonus.
<br><br><strong>Water.</strong> You embody the unstoppable power of a crushing wave. You have a swimming speed of 30 feet, and you can breath in both air and water. For the duration of your rage, you can take the Dash and Disengage actions as bonus actions, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and on saving throws against becoming grappled or restrained. In addition, you can spend 5 feet on your turn when you are grappled or restrained to end that effect.
