        <h1>Path of the Slayer</h1>
        Fueled by an unbreakable will and the rage to match, those who choose the Path of the Slayer devote their existence to a single, relentless purpose. In this quest there is no peace or respite, only the broken bodies of those who would stand in the barbarian's way. For theirs is the path of perpetual torment, their souls blistered by ravenous fury and tainted beyond redemption.
<h2>Unyielding</h2>
When you choose this Path at 3rd level, your unbridled rage and determination can keep you going when others would falter. While raging you can use a bonus action to spend a number of hit dice up to half your barbarian level. For each die spent you regain a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier.
<h2>Feed the Fury</h2>
Also at 3rd level, the act of slaughtering your foes fuels your conviction. Whenever you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you regain a number of barbarian hit dice equal to half the creature's challenge rating (rounded up).
<h2>Unrelenting</h2>
By 6th level, your iron resolve overcomes any attempt to sway you from your course. While raging your movement speed cannot be reduced by another creature. Additionally, being charmed by a creature does not prevent you from attacking it and you ignore similar effects that would prevent you from attacking a specific creature, such as the Sanctuary spell or Instinctive Charm feature.
<h2>Blood Strike</h2>
Starting at 10th level you can use your own vitality to infuse your attacks with relentless fury. As a bonus action you can spend a number of hit dice up to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one). The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack before the end of your next turn, the target and any creatures within 5 feet of it (other than you) must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save a creature takes 1d10 force damage for each hit die spent, or half as much on a successful save.
<h2>Rip and Tear</h2>
Beginning at 14th level, your terrible wrath can eviscerate lesser foes. When a melee attack you make against an object or creature reduces it to a number of hit points lower than your strength score, you can use your reaction to immediately reduce the target to 0 hit points.
