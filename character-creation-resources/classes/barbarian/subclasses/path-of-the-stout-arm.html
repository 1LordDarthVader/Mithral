        <h1>Path of the Stout Arm</h1>
        When it comes to ranged warfare, they often say that power is nothing without accuracy. There are a few stubborn individuals out there who believe the exact opposite is true. They surmise that you could hit a man with a pebble, but the only way to have any real effect is the throw that pebble with enough power to penetrate his skull and leave an exit wound.<br><br>
Those who follow the path of the Stout arm do not shun accuracy. Rather, they have spent much of their time practicing throwing weapons with as much power and accuracy as physically possible; specifically in that order. Their throws are powerful enough to knock a soldier clean off his feet, and trolls to stumble.
<h2>Powerful Throwing Arm</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, when you choose this subclass, you can propel objects with incredible power. You can add your rage damage bonus to ranged attacks made with thrown weapons.<br><br>
Additionally, while you are raging, if you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack made with a thrown weapon, you can force them to make a Strength saving throw with a DC of 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save they are knocked prone or pushed up to 10 feet away from you (your choice).
<h2>Tunnel Vision</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you can use your bonus action to ignore everything else and focus on a single target you choose. Until the start of your next turn, you can triple your rage damage bonus against that target. However, while this is happening, you cannot make attacks against other targets, all attack made against you have advantage, and you temporarily lose the benefits of your Danger Sense feature
<h2>Forceful Reposition</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can throw your allies, or your enemies, with all the ease of tossing a stone. As a bonus action, you can throw an ally you can reach that is of the same size as you or smaller in a direction of your choice.<br><br>
If you attempt to use this feature on an enemy, you must first succeed on a contested grapple check, otherwise you cannot throw them and the action is wasted.
<h2>Giant's Throwing Arm</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can turn normal everyday objects into dangerous projectiles. While you are raging, ranged weapon attacks you make with thrown weapons receive the benefits of your Brutal Critical feature.<br><br>
Additionally, if you make a thrown ranged weapon attack, the attack deals an additional 1d10 damage. The effective and maximum ranges of thrown weapons you use is increased by an amount equal to 5 times your Barbarian level.
