<h1>Path of Dread</h1>

There are places beyond time, filled with malignant intelligence and ruinous intent. The Far Realm is one such reality beyond the Material Plane, beyond the Elemental Chaos, even beyond the Upper Planes of the gods and the Outer Planes such as the Outlands. The Far Realm is entirely separate from the known multiverse, and it is believed that aberrations such as mind flayers and beholders either originated from this plane or were shaped by its strange influence.

<br><br>You stepped through the door to nowhere that led to the Far Realms at some point in your past, yet your mind cracked under the horrible vistas of forgotten power that stood just within your feeble mortal grasp. Now you have finally realized that the true source of your furious rage is both defiance and acceptance of the madness that lies in the darkness between the stars.

<h2>The Lurking Fear</h2>
At 3rd level, in your bouts of rage you ramble about twisted things. You gain resistance to all damage inflicted by frightened creatures while you are raging.

<br><br>Whenever you are raging, each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw with DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Once a creature fails this saving throw, it can’t be frightened by this feature again for 1 minute.

<br><br>Additionally, you can use your Charisma modifier in place of your Intelligence modifier when making skill checks and saving throws.

<h2>From Beyond</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your words seem to cut at the minds of those who listen even more horribly than before.

<br><br>As an action, you whisper into the mind of a creature within 60 feet of you that can see and hear you. Until the end of your next turn, you have advantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws involving your target or actions it has taken. During this time, the target has disadvantage on all ability checks and attack rolls involving you or actions you have taken. Targets that are immune to being frightened are immune to this effect.

<br><br>You can use this ability once, and you recover your use of this ability whenever you enter a rage.

<h2>The Thing on the Doorstep</h2>
At 10th level, your hallucinations slowly enter reality. Whenever you enter a rage, you can choose to unleash the horrors that dwell within your mind upon the world.

<br><br>Choose a number of creatures up to your Charisma modifier within 30 feet of you. Each one that is Large or smaller is pulled to the nearest open space within 5 feet of you, or the nearest available space by massive tendrils that spawn from the air around you.

<br><br>Until the end of your turn, when the tendrils disappear, you cannot suffer disadvantage from any source on any check made to grapple one of these creatures.

<h2>What the Moon Brings</h2>
At 14th level, the tendrils of the Old Ones constantly lurk at the corners of your vision. Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can choose to allow an Old One to lash out from within your skin.

<br><br>Choose a creature within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your own Strength (Athletics) check. If the target fails, the tendril snares them and drags them into the closest open space near you, and the creature gains one level of exhaustion. A creature cannot be affected by this feature more than once per turn.
