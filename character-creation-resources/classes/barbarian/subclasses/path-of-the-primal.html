        <h1>Path of the Primal</h1>

        Your people have long hunted the wilds to survive. You have perfected your hunter's instincts through the strong bond you have formed with a beast of particular cunning. This bond allows you to work together, transforming you into a brutal and efficient team.

        <h2>Apex Companion</h2>

        At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. It is able to understand simple speech and commands. The beast grows along with you, using your proficiency bonus (PB) as its own. The beast can be created using the <a href="../beast-companion.html">Beast Companion rules</a>. Choose traits that fit the type of creature you wish to bond with, or use one of the example stat blocks.<br><br>
        In combat, the beast acts during your turn and moves at your command. It can use its reaction and bonus action (if applicable) on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can instead sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to use an Attack, Dash, Disengage or Help action. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.  You can command your beast as part of the same bonus action you use to enter your rage.<br><br>
        Like a player character, the beast becomes unconscious at 0 hit points and makes death saving throws. If the beast has died within the last hour, you can spend 10 minutes using a healing poultice to revive it with half the hit points normally provided by the healing poultice. You cannot revive the beast again in this way until you and your companion have completed a long rest.<br><br>
        The beast also follows all resting rules that apply to player characters, including the ability to roll Hit Dice to regain hit points on a short rest.

        <h2>Primal Bond</h2>

        At 6th level, the bond you share with your apex companion intensifies, providing the following benefits while you are raging:

        <br><br><strong>Cull the Herd.</strong> When your Apex Companion hits a creature with an attack, the creature takes an additional 1d8 damage if it is below its hit point maximum.  Your Apex Companion can deal this extra damage no more than once per turn.

        <br><br><strong>Relentless.</strong> Your Apex Companion has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

        <h2>Primal Guardian</h2>

        Starting at 10th level, when a creature within 5 feet of your apex companion makes an attack against a target other than itself, it can use its reaction to make a melee attack against the attacking creature.

        <h2>Lead the Hunt</h2>

        At 14th level, you can spread your ferocity to others and gain resilience from them joining your hunt. When you enter your rage, you can choose a number of other willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one creature). You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature that accepts this feature. Until the rage ends, the chosen creatures can add your Rage Damage to all damage rolls until your rage ends.
