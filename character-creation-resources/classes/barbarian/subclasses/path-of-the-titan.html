        <h1>Path of the Titan</h1>
        Giants are the stuff of legend, enormous berserkers who inspire a primal fear in mortals. Barbarians who follow the path of the titan use ancient giant magic to grow to extraordinary sizes.
<h2>Titan-Sized</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, when you rage you can also grow. Using the same bonus action you use to enter a rage, you can grow to the size of a Large creature. While enlarged, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Your size doubles in all dimensions and your weight is multiplied by eight.</li>
<li>Your melee attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage.</li>
<li>You can use this feature a number of times equal to half of your maximum rages (rounding up), and regain all expended uses on a long rest.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Runic Armor</h2>
Starting at 6th level, the giant magic within you grants you improved defense. You gain resistance to a type of damage determined by the type of giant you choose below.

<h2>Giant's Grasp</h2>
Starting at 10th level, your grasp can challenge that even of a true giant. You can grapple any creature, regardless of size, and can drag them at no penalty to your movement.
<h2>Giant-Sized</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can temporarily grow even larger. You can expend two uses of your Titan-Sized feature at once to grow to the size of a Huge creature. While enlarged, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Your size quadruples in all dimensions and your weight is multiplied by sixty-four.</li>
<li>Your melee attacks deal an extra 2d4 damage.</li>
<li>Your unarmed strikes deal 1d10 bludgeoning damage.</li>
</ul>
