        <h1>Path of the Bound One</h1>
        Some barbarians lack the mortal willpower and fortitude necessary to fight with the reckless abandon that accompanies their creed, but seem to somehow do so anyways. While this can occasionally mean a barbarian who draws power from totems or spirits, there are a rare few who draw power from something far more eldritch.<br><br>
These barbarians are known as bound ones. Whether they know it or not, they are bound to serve an eldritch being, in soul and body. In this respect, they share much in common with warlocks. However, where a warlock would actively consort with their patron to become more powerful, most bound ones seek to escape their chains and become free, a blessing that only a rare, lucky few will ever experience.<br><br>
The patrons of bound ones are extraordinarily powerful beings, who have bound the very souls and essences of these barbarians to do their bidding, and are almost always evil and tyrannical beings. They rarely care for the health of their servant, and most would order the bound one on a suicide mission without a second thought.
<h2>Soulbound Restraints</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you can manifest the restraints of your soul when you enter your rage. They appear as chains, vines, tentacles, or something else based on your history and patron.<br><br>
As a bonus action, you can attempt to grapple a creature you can see within 20 feet of you using your restraints. You have two such restraints, each of which can grapple only one creature.
<h2>Chained Partner</h2>
Also starting at 3rd level, you gain the service of a being also bound and sent by your patron. You can cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=281">Find Familiar</a> spell as a ritual, requiring no material components. When cast in this way, the familiar is of a creature type appropriate to your patron.
<h2>Ethereal Restraints</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your restraints can bind even the slipperiest of creatures. When you use your Soulbound Restraints feature, you ignore immunity to the grappled condition.
<h2>Vicious Reel</h2>
Starting at 10th level, you can command your restraints to reel a creature closer to you. As a bonus action, you can force a creature held by one of your restraints to make a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be pulled 10 feet straight towards you. A flying creature has disadvantage on this saving throw. If the target is pulled within 5 feet of you, you can make a single melee weapon attack against them as part of the same action.<br><br>
Whether or not the target succeeds on their saving throw, they are released from your restraints when you use this feature.
<h2>Endless Chains</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you can focus your restraining efforts on one target. As an action while raging, you can cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=399">Hold Monster</a> spell, which is cast normally and can be concentrated on despite your rage. While concentrating on this spell, you cannot use your Soulbound Restraints feature. Strength is your spellcasting ability for it.<br><br>
You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
