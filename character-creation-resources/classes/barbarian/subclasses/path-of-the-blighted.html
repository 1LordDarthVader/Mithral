        <h1>Path of the Blighted</h1>
        The Path of the Blighted is a path of unholy origin, traced back to the same origin of the Blights: the Gulthias Tree. By gaining power from this evil source, you can channel your rage to shift your physical form, becoming a monstrous abomination of vines and branches. While transformed, you engulf and constrict your enemies as you tear them apart.
<h2>Blighted Transformation</h2>
When you choose this path at 3rd level, you become a blighted monster when you rage. For the duration of your rage, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target with blighted vines that sprout out of your body. This grapple does not require a free hand, but otherwise follows all of the rules for grappling. You can only have one creature grappled with this feature at a time.<br><br>
If you already have a creature grappled with this feature, this bonus action instead constricts the target, causing them to take bludgeoning damage equal to half your barbarian level, rounded up.
<h2>False Appearance</h2>
Beginning at 6th level, your body is now able to become temporarily plantlike to hide from foes. You can attempt the Hide action against the surface of a plant, such as the bark of a tree, a large bush, or an area of thick vines. When you do so, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check with advantage, remaining camouflaged until you move or take an action.
<h2>Unnatural Growth</h2>
At 10th level, you can cast the Plant Growth spell once with this feature, and you regain the ability to cast it this way once you finish a long rest.
<h2>Reactive Tendrils</h2>
Starting at 14th level, whenever you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you while you're raging, you can use your reaction to release grasping vines at the attacker, attempting to grapple the target if you are not already grappling them, or injuring them if you are as if using your Blighted Transformation feature.
