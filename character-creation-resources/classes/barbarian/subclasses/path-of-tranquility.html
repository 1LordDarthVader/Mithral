        <h1>Path of Tranquility</h1>
        When one pictures a barbarian, they usually picture a frothing maniac, swinging an enormous axe and hacking through their enemies in a mindless frenzy. Barbarians who follow the Path of Tranquility aim to combat this notion. They can enter a steely calm battle meditation, empowering both their physical and mental fortitude. However, the calmness of a tranquil barbarian should never been taken lightly. They are still just as capable of killing.<br><br>
Barbarians of this path have much in common with monks, acting much more solemn and stoic than most of their kind. They learn to tap into the powers of the Astral Plane, and more powerful tranquils can even blast one's astral self out of their body temporarily.
<h2>Battle Meditation</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, your rage manifests less as a mindless frenzy and more as a battle meditation you use to enter a state of zen in the heat of combat. You gain the following benefits while raging:
<ul>
<li>You may use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Constitution modifier when determining the Armor Class granted by your Unarmored Defense feature.</li>
<li>The bonus damage from your Rage applies to all attacks, as opposed to only Strength-based attacks.</li>
<li>You gain advantage on Dexterity skill checks.</li>
</ul>
In addition, you learn the Mind Sliver cantrip and one other cantrip of your choice from the divination or enchantment schools, and can cast them even while raging. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
<h2>Mental Hardening</h2>
Starting at 6th level, your meditation hardens your mind against all manner of mental attacks. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.<br><br>
In addition, while raging you are immune to effects that would force you to act against your will, such as the charmed condition or the command spell.
<h2>Zen Guardian</h2>
Starting at 10th level, your connection to the Astral Plane allows you to temporarily stave off death against you allies. While you are raging, allies within 30 feet have advantage on death saving throws and cannot become undead by any means short of the wish spell.
<h2>Astral Fury</h2>
Starting at 14th level, you learn to unleash the astral power of your tranquility in one awesome blast. As an action while you are raging, you can force creatures of your choice within 30 feet to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus). Creatures who fail their saving throw take 8d6 force damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn as their astral form is blasted out of their body. Creatures who succeed their saving throw take half as much damage and aren't stunned
You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
