        <h1>Path of the Battlerager</h1>
        Known as Kuldjargh (literally &quot;axe idiot&quot;) in Dwarvish, battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war and take the Path of the Battlerager. They specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.<br><br>
While most battleragers are dwarves, the tradition is passed on to a few outsiders, and some outsiders have similar fighting styles by mere coincidence.
<h2>Battlerager Armor</h2>
When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use spiked armor as a weapon.<br><br>
While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with your armor spikes against a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal 1d6 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.<br><br>
Additionally, when you grapple a creature or are grappled by a creature, the target takes piercing damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of 1).

<h2>Reckless Abandon</h2>
Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.
<h2>Battlerager Charge</h2>
Beginning at 10th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action while you are raging.
<h2>Spiked Retribution</h2>
Starting at 14th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes piercing damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of 1) if you are raging, aren't incapacitated, and are wearing spiked armor.
