        <h1>Path of the Dragon</h1>
        Barbarians tap into primal powers, and a Barbarian of this path taps into one of the most ancient and primeval of them all: the power of dragons. Some say this path was born by mortals tapping into the primal rage of Tiamat herself, others say that only those with latent dragon blood coursing through them can walk this path. What all can agree on is that the result is a being to be feared.<br><br>
As with most Barbarians, the ones following this path tend toward Chaos, as they contain potent destructive power that paces at the edges of the cage, just waiting to be unleashed. Some, particularly those rare individuals that channel metallic colors, may be exceptions to this tendency.
<h2>Dragon Form</h2>
When you choose this path at 3rd level, when you enter a rage, you take on aspects of a draconic being, growing savage natural weapons as claws grow from your hands, fangs sprout from your maw, and a vicious lashing tail grows from your back which you can use to make unarmed strikes.

Whenever you attack with one of your natural weapons using the Attack action on your turn, if you are not carrying any weapon or shield, you can make a single unarmed strike with your claws as a bonus action.<br><br>
When you gain this feature, you pick a type of dragon, and gain resistance corresponding to the element type of that type on the following chart while raging.

<h2>Unleashed Savagery</h2>
Starting at 6th level, the natural weapons you gain while raging now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.<br><br>
Additionally, once during a rage, as an action, you can unleash your Rage into pure energy, exhaling a blast of elemental power. Creatures within 15 foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + your proficiency modifier + your strength modifier. A creature takes 6d6 damage of the Elemental Type of your Dragon Type on a failed save.<br><br>
This increase by 2d6 at 9th level (8d6), 12th level (10d6), 15th level (12d6), and 18th level (14d6).
<h2>Dragonhide</h2>
Starting at 10th level, the marks of your Draconic path no longer entirely fade; heavy scales grant you resistance to your Dragon Color's Elemental Type and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical sources even when you are not raging.
<h2>Tyrant of the Skies</h2>
By 14th level, when you enter a rage, massive dragon wings sprout from your back. You gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed.
