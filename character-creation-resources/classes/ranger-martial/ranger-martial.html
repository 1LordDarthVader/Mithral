<h1>Martial Ranger</h1>

Rangers may live on the fringes of civilization, but the wilderness is their true home. Rangers have a deep connection
to the land they make their home, and all its flora and fauna. Living off the land is second nature to them: they are
well-versed in tracking, hunting and gathering, reading the subtle messages hidden in the terrain. The ranger lives in
this world, yet stands apart from it; their knowledge, ingenuity and craftsmanship set them apart from wild beasts.
Instead, the ranger lives in balance between nature and civilization, one foot in each world, protecting each from the
other's encroachment, and threats from beyond.

    <li>(a) two scimitars or (b) two simple melee weapons</li>
    <li>a longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</li>
    <li>an herbalism kit and an equipment pack</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hunter's Prey</h3>
Starting at 1st level, you may use your bonus action to mark a single creature as your prey. You must be able to see or hear this creature, or succeed on a Wisdom (Survival) check to track it, the difficulty of which is determined by the Dungeon Master based on your access to tracks or other clues. You can also mark prey when you roll initiative, without expending a bonus action.
<br><br>
You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks to track your prey, as well as Wisdom (Perception) checks to find them. In addition, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack. This damage increases to 1d8 at 7th level, 1d10 at 13th level, and 1d12 at 19th level.
<br><br>
You can have only one creature marked as your prey at a time. This designation lasts until your next long rest, or until you mark a new creature as your prey. You may mark prey the number of times shown for your ranger level in the Martial Ranger class table, and you regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

<h3>Wilderness Expertise</h3>
At 1st level, you gain proficiency in Nature and Survival. If you were already proficient in either of these skills, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with that skill.

<h3>Favored Terrain</h3>
You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. At 1st level, choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark.
<br><br>
When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain or the creatures that dwell there, you have advantage on the check if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in. When in that terrain, you can ignore the effects of non-magical difficult terrain, and all enemies that attempt to track you by non-magical means have disadvantage. You can also move stealthily at a normal pace.

<h3>Fighting Style</h3>
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

<h4>Archery</h4>
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

<h4>Blind Fighting</h4>
You have blind sight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

<h4>Close Quarters Shooter</h4>
When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

<h4>Defensive Fighting</h4>
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

<h4>Dual Wielding</h4>
When you take the Attack action while two-weapon fighting, you can make a single additional attack with your off-hand weapon as part of your action instead of your bonus action, adding your ability modifier to the damage of this attack.

<h4>Dueling</h4>
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

<h4>Featherweight Fighting</h4>
While you are wielding only light weapons, your movement speed increases by 10 feet and you gain a +2 bonus to your damage rolls, so long as you are not wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or wielding a shield.

<h4>Melee Marksman</h4>
When you make a ranged attack targeting a creature within 5 feet of you, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll.
<br><br>
If you make a ranged attack against a creature within 5 feet, you can use a bonus action to strike the creature with your ranged weapon, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage on hit.

<h4>Strongbow</h4>
You can use your Strength score, in place of your Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls with bows. If using a composite bow, its special property changes to add your Dexterity modifier to the damage.

<h4>Thrown Weapon Fighting</h4>
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.
<br><br>
In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

<h3>Natural Healer</h3>
Your experience surviving in the harsh wilderness has taught you how to identify and make use of medicinal plants. Starting at 2nd level, you may spend 1 hour a day searching a natural area for helpful herbs and fungi; this can count as part of a short or long rest. Roll a Wisdom (Survival) check against the DC corresponding to your environment. You have advantage on this check in your favored terrain.

        <th colspan="2">Natural Healer DC</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Environment</th>
        <th>DC</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Forest, Grassland, Swamp</td>
        <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Mountain, Coast</td>
        <td>15</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td>20</td>
    </tr>
</table>

On a success, you find enough herbs to produce a number of healing poultices equal to your Wisdom modifier. You must have an herbalism kit to produce these items, which must be done at the end of your search time as part of the same hour. On a failure, you can only produce a number equal to half your Wisdom modifier (rounded down).
<br><br>
Healing poultices are non-magical items which can be applied by any creature with Survival or Medicine proficiency to itself or an adjacent creature, using an action on their turn. The target creature regains hit points equal to 1d6 for every two levels you have in this class (rounded down, as shown in the Martial Ranger table) and loses the poisoned condition. The healing poultice is consumed by this use. Healing poultices lose their potency 24 hours after being produced.

<h3>Ranger Archetype</h3>
At 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger archetype. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

<h3>Favored Enemy</h3>
By 3rd level, you have studied a specific type of enemy creature and can hunt it more easily. Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select a race of humanoid. You may also choose a particular faction.
<br><br>
You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track these creatures, and Intelligence checks to recall or discover information about them, such as Nature or Investigation checks. You also have advantage on saving throws against your favored enemy's characteristic innate abilities, such as a dragon's Frightful Presence or Breath Weapon, but not against spells they cast.
<br><br>
When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.
<br><br>
You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures. You can change one of your favored enemy choices when you gain a level in this class.

<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

<h3>Martial Versatility</h3>
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace a fighting style you know with another fighting style available to rangers. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.

<h3>Extra Attack</h3>
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

<h3>Martial Talent</h3>
At 5th level, you become further specialized in a form of combat characteristic of rangers. Choose one of the following options:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Far Shot.</strong> Double your ranged or thrown weapons’ short and long ranges. (Attacking at long range still imposes disadvantage).</li>
    <li><strong>Mighty Strike.</strong> If you are wielding only one melee weapon and use it to hit your prey, you can choose to reroll your Hunter's Prey damage. You must take the new result.</li>
    <li><strong>Twin Takedown.</strong> When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can make your offhand attack as part of the Attack action, instead of using your bonus action.</li>
</ul>

You can replace your Martial Talent with another option whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature.

<h3>Roving</h3>
At 6th level, your walking speed increases by 5 feet, and you gain a climbing speed and swimming speed equal to your walking speed. Your speeds increase by an additional 5 feet while in your favored terrain.

<h3>Hunter's Instinct</h3>
Starting at 7th level, your sharply honed instincts allow you to act quickly in the face of danger. You add a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.

<h3>Wild Stride</h3>
Beginning at 8th level, your movement is unaffected by all difficult terrain, including magical difficult terrain.

<h3>Favored Terrain Master</h3>
At 9th level, your mastery of your favored terrain grants you benefits even outside of it. You gain a benefit based on your favored terrain type. If you have multiple favored terrains, you gain the benefit associated with each type.

<ul>
    <li><strong>Arctic.</strong> You gain resistance to cold damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme cold.</li>
    <li><strong>Coast.</strong> Your swimming speed increases by 10 feet and you can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Desert.</strong> You gain resistance to fire damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme heat.</li>
    <li><strong>Forest.</strong> Your climbing speed increases by 10 feet and you ignore penalties to Dexterity (Stealth) checks from wearing medium armor.</li>
    <li><strong>Grassland.</strong> Your walking speed increases by 10 feet; this does not affect your climbing or swimming speeds.</li>
    <li><strong>Mountain.</strong> Your climbing speed increases by 10 feet and you have resistance to damage from falling.</li>
    <li><strong>Swamp.</strong> You gain resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against poison.</li>
    <li><strong>Underdark.</strong> You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, increase its range by 30 feet.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nature’s Veil</h3>
At 10th level, you can add your proficiency bonus to Stealth checks made in natural terrain, or double your proficiency bonus instead if you were already proficient in Stealth, and you have advantage on Stealth checks made in your favored terrain. You can also Hide as a bonus action in any terrain. You cannot be tracked by non-magical means in any terrain, unless you wish to leave a trail.

<h3>Tireless Endurance</h3>
At 13th level, you persist through pain, exhaustion, and even near-death. As an action, you can give yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). You can use this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<br><br>
Whenever you finish a short rest, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1.
<br><br>
In addition, you have advantage on death saving throws.

<h3>Split Focus</h3>
Starting at 17 level, you can focus on two foes at once, hunting both of them down. When you mark prey with Hunter's Prey, you can pick up to two creatures as your prey at the cost of one use, and you can have two active prey simultaneously.

<h3>Killer Instinct</h3>
Beginning at 18th level, you can strike the most evasive of enemies, even those hiding behind obscured visibility or magical protection. Your attack rolls against creatures marked as your prey ignore disadvantage. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't both blinded and deafened.

<h3>Apex Predator</h3>
At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Add a bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier to all attack and damage rolls made against creatures marked as your prey.
