<h1>Atavist</h1>

Before iron, before the blade, before organized cities, there were the atavists - using the only tools they had available: their bodies and their magic. In tandem, they use these dual aspects to protect, to conquer, to hunt monsters, or to achieve any other ends.

<h2>Class Features</h2>

As an atavist, you gain the following class features.

<h3>Hit Points</h3>
<strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d6 per atavist level<br>
<strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 6 + your Constitution modifier<br>
<strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per atavist level after 1st

<h3>Proficiencies</h3>
<strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields<br>
<strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br>
<strong>Tools:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Constitution<br>
<strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Survival

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
    <li>(a) leather armor or (b) scale mail</li>
    <li>(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</li>
    <li>(a) two spears or (b) any martial weapon</li>
    <li>an equipment pack</li>
</ul>

<h3>Painful</h3>
<em>Optional Feature</em><br>
You have a d4 for your hit dice (4 + CON mod hit points at 1st), instead of a d6. Your rend dice begin as a d4 and progress to 2d8, 3d8, and 4d8.

<h3>Painless</h3>
<em>Optional Feature</em><br>
You have a d8 for your hit dice (8+ CON mod hit points at 1st), instead of a d6. Your rend dice begin as a d4 and progress to 2d4, 3d4, and 4d4.

<h3>Rend Ichor</h3>
You can tap into your raw health to deliver death. You have a rend die which powers certain class features, and is a d6. When you rend, you roll this die and lose hit points equal to the result, which can't be reduced in any way. You can't rend more than once for a feature unless the effect says so.
<br><br>
When a feature says that you can rend to a roll, it means that you can rend yourself and add the result of the rend die to the roll. You can rend yourself to any damage roll for an attack with a melee weapon as a part of the Attack action, for a spell attack, for a reaction, or for a bonus action. You can rend any amount of times per turn.
<br><br>
At 7th level, you can rend to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and you can roll 2d6 for your rend dice. At 14th level, you can roll 3d6, and 4d6 at 20th.

<h3>Unstopping Heart</h3>
Once per turn, when rending yourself would reduce you to 0 hit points, you are instead reduced to 1. Additionally, you are proficient in death saving throws, and if the result of a death saving throw you make is 18 or higher, you regain 1 hit point.

<h3>Spellcasting</h3>
By 2nd level, your physical essenceâ€”either through your family, the blessing of some divine (or unholy) being, or even through sheer chance has produced a fortified and living ichor within you, wieldable for magical prowess.

<h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
The Atavist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your atavist spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
<br><br>
You prepare the list of atavist spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the atavist spell list. When you do so, choose a number of atavist spells equal to your Constitution modifier + half your atavist level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
<br><br>
You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of atavist spells requires time spent attuning to your vitality: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

<h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your atavist spells, since the power of your magic relies on your own blood.
<br><br>
<strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier<br>
<strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

<h4>Self Focus</h4>
When you cast spells that require a material component, you ignore that component unless it has a value.

<h3>Hardened Viscera</h3>
At 2nd level, your body takes on physical traits and aspects of the toughest people and most resolute populations. You gain the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>While you aren't wearing heavy armor, you can reduce any damage you take by 2.</li>
    <li>Your hit point maximum can't be reduced.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Atavistic Aspect</h3>
Choose an aspect at 3rd level, which describes and emulates your bodily magical power. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 18th levels.

<ul>
<li><a href="./subclasses/anomalous-aspect.html">Anomalous Aspect</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/bloodied-aspect.html">Bloodied Aspect</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/crourwrought-aspect.html">Crourwrought Aspect</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/demonic-aspect.html">Demonic Aspect</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/heavenly-aspect.html">Heavenly Aspect</a></li>
<li><a href="./subclasses/murderous-aspect.html">Murderous Aspect</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Aspect Spells</h3>
Each aspect has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells when you can cast a spell of its level, as is on the table. Once you gain access to an aspect spell, you always have it prepared. Aspect spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
<br><br>
If you gain an aspect spell that doesn't appear on the atavist spell list, the spell is nonetheless an atavist spell for you.

<h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

<h3>Avenging Attack</h3>
Starting at 5th level, when an attack hits you, you fail a saving throw, or you fail an ability check that requires an attack or an action, you can make a weapon attack against any creature within range as a reaction.
<br><br>
At 11th level, you can make two weapon attacks as part of this reaction.

<h3>Humansbane</h3>
Starting at 6th level, you exude physical might, and can take apart lesser humanoids with single blows. Whenever you hit a humanoid with an attack and rend to its damage, the creature is instantly slain if the damage reduces their hit points to 10 or lower.
<br><br>
At 10th level, the humanoid is instantly slain if it has 15 or fewer hit points remaining. At 14th level, it increases to 20, and 25 at 18th level.

<h3>Greater Viscera</h3>
At 7th level, your body has taken on bedrock and efficient properties. You gain the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>While you aren't wearing heavy armor, you can reduce any damage you take by 4, and 6 at 15th level.</li>
    <li>When you take damage from a creature other than you, your next rend doesn't lose you hit points within the next minute.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sanguine Sacrament</h3>
Starting at 14th level, you begin to unravel hallowed secrets of the interwoven magic and body called a sacrament. Choose one 5th-level spell from the atavist spell list as this sacrament.
<br><br>
You can cast this sacrament spell or an aspect spell of the same spell level once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more atavist spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 6th-level spell at 17th level and one 7th-level spell at 20th level.
<br><br>
You regain all uses of your Sanguine Sacrament when you finish a long rest.

<h3>Nigh Immortality</h3>
At 20th level, you are all but impossible to kill. Your body doesn't age, and if you die and at least one part of your body existsâ€”such as a fingernail or an eyeâ€”your body can regrow from that part over the course of 24 hours. At the end of that time, you return to life with 1 hit point. If you were killed due to the disintegrate spell or a similar effect, your body has no healthy parts remaining to restore from. If your body has been burned completely through or otherwise ruined with powerful spells and abilities that affect an area (such as a dragon's breath weapon or cone of cold), you can still regrow from internal body parts as long as the damage taken doesn't exceed half your hit point maximum. Finally, if you are dead or not yet fully regrown, any magic attempting to raise your body as an undead succeeds, but you instantly gain control.
