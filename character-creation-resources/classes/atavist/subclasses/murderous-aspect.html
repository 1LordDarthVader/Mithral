        <h1>Murderous Aspect</h1>
        Murderous atavists are honed on the hunt: they use their power to deplete and destroy others. They attack strategically weak spots in a creature, taking them down in stride. Their motivations for this are more varied than the monsters and people they kill: money, fame, altruism, addiction, blackmail, divine, profane, insanity, vengeance, thrill seeking, political gain, or any other inscrutable motivations; perhaps some don't have or need a reason.

<h2>Fighting Maneuvers</h2>
Beginning at 3rd level, you've disciplined raw power into a fighting form. Choose two of the following fighting maneuvers, for which you can't choose the same again.
<h3>Parry</h3>
If you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a single melee weapon and no shield, you can use your bonus action to ready a parrying maneuver. You have a bonus to your AC equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) against the first melee attack made against you before the start of your next turn.
<h3>Power Attack</h3>
When you take the Attack action on your turn and make a heavy melee weapon attack against a creature with advantage, you can choose to forgo advantage and make a powerful strike. If you hit, you deal additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
<h3>Pushing Attack</h3>
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack while wielding a shield, you can attempt to drive the target back. If the target is Large or smaller, you can push the target up to 5 feet away from you.
<h3>Twin Strike</h3>
When you take the Attack action on your turn, and have a different light melee weapon in each hand, you can use your bonus action to make a twin strike with both weapons. Make a single attack roll against a creature within reach of both weapons. If either weapon has the finesse property, you can choose to use your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier for this attack. You do not add your ability modifier to the damage of either weapon.
<h2>Lethal Strike</h2>
Also at 3rd level, you can rip a creature apart with a killer's instinct, knowing exactly where to strike. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if there is no other creature hostile to you within 5 feet of the target or if a creature other than you that is hostile to the target is within 5 feet of it.<br><br>
The amount of damage you gain increases as you reach higher levels: it becomes 2d6 at level 6, 3d6 at 10th, and 4d6 at 18th.
<h2>Skirmisher</h2>
Starting at 6th level, you become highly effective at tracking and eluding enemies. You gain proficiency in the Stealth and Survival skills, and for one of those skills of your choice, you double your proficiency bonus for any ability checks made with that skill. Finally, you can take the Dash, Hide, and Search actions as a bonus action.
<h2>Crourbent Accuracy</h2>
At 10th level, you can rend yourself to an attack roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.<br><br>
Additionally, when you rend to an attack roll, you can use your Lethal Strike feature even if you don't meet the prerequisites.
<h2>Life for Life, Blood for Blood</h2>
Beginning at 18th level, you can match a life form's health in a brazen contest of power. When you score a critical hit on a creature, you can trade blood for blood. The creature with less hit points remaining falls to 0 hit points and the creature with more loses an equal amount.<br><br>
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
