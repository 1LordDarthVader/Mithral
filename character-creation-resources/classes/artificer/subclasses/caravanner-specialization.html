        <h1>Caravanner Specialization</h1>
        Every adventuring party needs a safe place to rest. A Caravaneer is a master of hospitality who maintains and provides a smoking magical vehicle to act as a home away from home for any diligent traveler.
<h2>Tool Proficiency</h2>
When you adopt this Artificer specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with mason's tools and all vehicle types. If you already have the tools proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.
<h2>Caravaneer spells</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Caravaneer Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

<h2>Arcane Caravan</h2>
By 3rd level, you have created a mobile home known as an arcane caravan. You determine the arcane caravan's appearance, but it must have at least one door, window, and headlight, as well as a chimney that exhausts harmless smoke whenever the arcane caravan is controlled. Its size is Large or Huge (your choice with DM's permission) and it weighs 6,000 pounds or 12,000 pounds respectively.<br><br>
The arcane caravan has an AC of 15 and hit points equal to five times your level in this class. It has a walking speed of 25 feet and a headlight that can cast bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Its chimney can exhaust harmful smoke, forcing creatures within 10 feet to make a Constitution saving throw against your Artificer spell save DC. On a failed save, they take 1d10 + 2 poison damage and are pushed 5 feet away. The bonus to this damage increases by 1 whenever your proficiency bonus increases by 1. You can control all these abilities by using an action with a console inside, which allows you to see as if you were in the arcane caravan's space.<br><br>
Inside the arcane caravan is an extradimensional dwelling. It is warm and dry, regardless of conditions outside. You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can't exceed 10 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side, and it must have at least one door and window that leads outside. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose, but it must include a fireplace that leads to the chimney and a console. When no creatures are inside except yourself, you can use mason's tools as an action to transform the extradimensional dwelling's layout. Any equipment or furnishings conjured within the arcane caravan dissipate into smoke if removed from it.<br><br>
If a spell that affects an area is cast within 5 feet of the fireplace, such as Burning Hands or Fog Cloud, the caster can choose to have it originated or centered on the arcane caravan's chimney, affecting the area outside.<br><br>
If an effect that deals fire damage occurs to the fireplace, the arcane caravan regains 2d4 hit points (only once per round). If its hit points are reduced to zero, all creatures and objects within the extradimensional dwelling are expelled through the chimney and fall prone into the nearest open spaces. You can then no longer control or enter the arcane caravan until it is revived. You can use mason's tools as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The arcane caravan then returns to life after 1 hour with all its hit points restored.<br><br>
Using mason's tools, you can spend 8 hours to construct a new arcane caravan. If you already have an arcane caravan from this feature, the first one immediately perishes.
<h2>Sigil Savant</h2>
At 5th level, you've mastered the craft of runes and sigils to provide more magical hospitality. When you cast a spell that can last permanently or until dispelled using your mason's tools, such as Arcane Lock, Magic Mouth, Glyph of Warding, Private Sanctum, Hallow, or Teleportation Circle, the casting time and the cost of material components are halved.
<h2>Travel Innovations</h2>
At 9th level, you have vastly upgraded your arcane caravan's travel and safety methods:
<ul>
<li>You can choose burrowing, flying, or swimming speed when you finish a short or long rest in your arcane caravan's extradimensional dwelling, provided you work with mason's tools for 1 hour. Your arcane caravan gains 25 feet of that movement speed until you choose a different one with this feature.</li>
<li>You can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest in your arcane caravan's extradimensional dwelling, provided you work with mason's tools for 1 hour. Your arcane caravan gains immunity to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Five Star Service</h2>
At 15th level, your arcane caravan has become the ultimate method of transportation and hospitality:
<ul>
<li>The maximum space of your arcane caravan's extradimensional dwelling is increased to 100 cubes.</li>
<li>When you control your arcane caravan, its speed and travel pace are doubled and its movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, spells, and other magical effects.</li>
<li>You can cast Dimension Door to teleport to or from your arcane caravan's extradimensional space without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use mason's tools as the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
</ul>
