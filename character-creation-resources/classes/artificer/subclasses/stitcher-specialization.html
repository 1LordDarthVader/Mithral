<h1>Stitcher Specialization</h1>

While most artificers are content with mechanical innovation, some see biology, the science of living things, as an area rife with potential. Stitchers are those who use their talents to supplement their own anatomy and create life. Combining necromancy and transmutation magic, Stitchers see all living things as prototypes that can be magically evolved.

<h2>Tool Proficiency</h2>
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with leatherworker's tools. If you are already proficient with leatherworker's tools, you gain proficiency with another set of artisan's tools of your choice.

<h2>Stitcher Spells</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Stitcher Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

<h2>Stitcher's Graft</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you enhance bodies by crafting or mutating a new part through grotesque experimentation. Using 10 minutes of time and 1 pound of organic matter, you can give a willing creature temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your artificer level. Once a creature has gained temporary hit points this way, they cannot benefit from it again until they finish a short or long rest.

<br><br>While you have temporary hit points, you can use your Intelligence score instead of Strength for attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws that use your Strength.

<br><br>Whenever you give yourself or another creature temporary hit points with a spell or ability, you may also grant them the benefits of one of the Grafted Traits below, which lasts as long as they have those temporary hit points.

<br><br><strong>Amphibious Physiology.</strong> You can breathe both air and water, and gains a 30 foot swim speed.
<br><br><strong>Resilient Hide.</strong> While you are not wearing any armor or using a shield, your Armor Class is equal to 10 + your Intelligence modifier + your Constitution modifier.
<br><br><strong>Extra Limb.</strong> You grow an additional limb which resembles your own limbs. It has a reach of 10 feet, and can lift a number of pounds equal to your Intelligence score. The limb can attack, but can't use weapons or shields nor can it do anything that requires manual precision.

<h2>Augmented Flesh</h2>
Starting at 5th level, you gain the following benefits:

<ul>
    <li>As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot to grant yourself temporary hit points equal to five times the level of the spell slot + your Intelligence modifier.</li>
    <li>You may touch another creature as an action and sacrifice any amount of your temporary hit points, healing the target for the same amount by grafting your flesh to theirs. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and you regain all expended uses after you finish a long rest.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extra Attack</h2>
Also starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

<h2>Strange Evolution</h2>
At 9th level, you have enhanced your own physiology with strange magic. You permanently gain one Grafted Trait of your choice. You also gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without making an ability check.

<br><br>When you reach 15th level in this class, you gain a second permanent Grafted Trait of your choice (for a total of two).

<h2>Master Stitcher</h2>
Beginning at 15th level, you have become a master amongst Stitcher artificers. When you target a creature with a spell of 1st-level or higher, you can grant a single target temporary hit points equal to your artificer level.

<br><br>In addition, while you have temporary hit points, you are resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
