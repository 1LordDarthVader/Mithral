<h1>Lapidist Specialization</h1>

A Lapidist specializes in the creation of magical gemstones and prisms. These crystals focus and split their spells, and allow them to easily expand or focus their magic. The crystals that lapidists create can be used by them or their allies, which makes them wonderful support for any variety of offensive spellcaster.

<h2>Tool Proficiency</h2>
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with jeweler's tools. If you are already proficient with jeweler's tools, you gain proficiency with another set of artisan's tools of your choice.

<h2>Lapidist Spells</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Lapidist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

<h2>Runic Crystal</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you forge a runic crystal, an iridescent and enscorcelled crystal, through which to channel spells. When you finish a long rest, you can magically produce a Runic Crystal, provided you have jeweler's tools in hand. Your Runic Crystal is a Tiny object with a flying speed of 30 feet and the ability to hover.

<br><br>You can create additional Runic Crystals by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. In any case, you can have a maximum number of crystals equal to your proficiency bonus. If you attempt to exceed the limit, the oldest existing crystal becomes inert.

<br><br>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move your Runic Crystal up to its speed. You can cast spells from your location or from the location of your Runic Crystal.

<br><br>When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more crystals at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. The crystals function identically, and you can move one or multiple with a bonus action.

<h2>Redirection</h2>
Starting at 5th level, you can redirect your spells through your Runic Crystal, reflecting the spell in a different direction.

<br><br>If you or a friendly creature causes an effect that affects an area of effect in a line, if you or your Runic Crystal is within the effect's area of effect, you can choose to redirect the effect's area of effect. If you do so, the line goes until you or the crystal and then turns in a direction of your choice and goes the remaining distance. A target can only be affected by a given effect once. For example, a lightning bolt spell could move 20 feet towards a crystal, turn, and then move another 80 feet in a new direction.

<br><br>When a target redirects a effect, it is unaffected by the effect.

<br><br>If you redirect an effect that does not have a duration of Instantaneous, the redirection ends if you or one of the crystals exits its area. You can change how crystals redirect an effect as part of the same bonus action you use to move them.

<br><br>Effects that qualify for this feature include line spells, a dragonborn's breath weapon (if they choose for it to be a line), or anything else that has a line area of effect.

<h2>Pinpoint Spell</h2>
Also starting at 5th level, you can focus spells into a point, blasting their energy forwards in a straight line. When you cast an artificer spell of 1st-level or higher that has an area of effect, you can choose to cast it as a line spell emanating from your location rather than with its existing area of effect, with the line being 5 feet wide and of a length equal to 30 times the level of spell slot expended.

<br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Splitting Redirection</h2>
Starting at 9th level, when you use your Redirection feature, you can choose to split the effect into multiple lines. If you do so, each line that you split the effect into has a range equal to the remaining range divided by the number of lines (rounding down to the nearest amount of 5 feet). For example, a lightning bolt spell could move 20 feet towards a crystal, and then be expelled as two 40-foot lines or four 20-foot lines.

<br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Refraction</h2>
Starting at 15th level, your Runic Crystals can function as magical prisms, refracting spells into cones of destructive force. When you use your Redirection feature, you can instead choose to have the Runic Crystal expel the spell as a cone with a size equal to half its remaining range (minimum of 5 feet). For example, a lightning bolt spell could move 20 feet towards a crystal, turn, and then be expelled as a 40-foot cone.

<br><br>You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so once you finish a long rest.
