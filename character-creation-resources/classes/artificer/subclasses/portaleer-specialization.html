        <h1>Portaleer Specialization</h1>
        Portaleers are artificers that specialize in conjuration magic. More specifically, they specialize in the portion of conjuration magic that deals with teleportation and planar travel. Powerful portaleers can traverse planes and teleport an object or creature across vast distances.
<h2>Portaleer Spells</h2>
When you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Portaleer Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

<h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>
When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with cartographer's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.
<h2>Ethereal Portals</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to create magical portals that allow quick travel between two nearby places. As an action, you can create two linked portals at grounded points of your choice within 120 feet. You choose the appearance of the portals, but they must still function as gateways. Thereafter, as a bonus action, you can move either of the portals to a point of your choice within 120 feet. You must concentrate to keep your portals active (as if concentrating on a spell), and they are destroyed if your concentration is lost.<br><br>
Portals are large enough to accommodate a medium creature without squeezing, and a creature or object in the space of one portal is simultaneously in the space of the corresponding portal. A creature that willingly enters a portal can choose to exit either portal's space, but an object not being worn or carried by a creature or a creature forced into a portal always exits the opposite portal's space. Portals also extend onto the Ethereal Plane, where they function identically.<br><br>
Portals have a maximum range of 300 feet, and are destroyed if you are farther than 500 feet from them. Portals cannot be created within an area of antimagic, and are destroyed if targeted by <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=213">Dispel Magic</a>. A portal without a pair is useless.
<h2>Defensive Teleport</h2>
Also starting at 3rd level, you can quickly teleport yourself out of harm's way. As a reaction when you are hit by an attack, you can teleport to the space of any of your active portals.<br><br>
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once) and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Planar Expert</h2>
Starting at 5th level, your knowledge of planes other than the material improves. You have advantage on checks made to recall information about planes other than the material and their inhabitants.<br><br>
In addition, as an action, you can pinpoint the location of the nearest planar portal.
<h2>Potent Spellcasting</h2>
Also starting at 5th level, you add your Intelligence modifier to the damage you deal with any artificer cantrip.
<h2>Planeswalker</h2>
Starting at 9th level, you can cast the <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=569">Plane Shift</a> spell once without expending a spell slot or material components, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.<br><br>
When cast in this way, the spell takes ten minutes to cast, and cannot teleport unwilling creatures.
<h2>Portalmaster</h2>
Starting at 15th level, your control of teleportation magic improves enough that you can sustain multiple portals at a time. You can now sustain two extra sets of portals, both of which are separately linked.<br><br>
In addition, your portals no longer require concentration, though you can only have a maximum of three sets of portals active at any given time.
