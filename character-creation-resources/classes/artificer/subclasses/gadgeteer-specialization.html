        <h1>Gadgeteer Specialization</h1>
        A gadgeteer is an expert of miscellaneous gadgets. Their creations may not be the most powerful things by themselves, but they enjoy making a great deal of unique gadgets that provide ample use to their wielders.
<h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>
When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with tinker's tools, or one other type of artisan's tools of your choice if already proficient.
<h2>Gadgeteer Spells</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Gadgeteer Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

<h2>Essential Tools</h2>
At 3rd level, you've mastered the creation of the essential reusable tools for surviving the battlefield as a gadgeteer. You gain two of the following gadgets of your choice. You may choose the same gadget twice, gaining two separate items.
<ul>
<li><strong>Boomerang of Hitting.</strong> You create a magical boomerang. You have proficiency with this weapon, and it has the following special property: when this weapon is thrown, you can target two creatures within 10 feet of each other, making a separate attack roll against each target.</li>
<li><strong>Grappling Hook.</strong> As an action, you may target a surface, object or creature within 20 feet. If the target is Small or Smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) grappling check to pull it 20 feet towards you and grapple it. Alternatively, if the target is Medium or larger, you can choose to be pulled 20 feet to it, however, this does not grapple it.</li>
<li><strong>Impact Gauntlet.</strong> You create a magical gauntlet. You have proficiency with this weapon, and it has the following special property: when you make an attack roll, you can choose to forgo adding your proficiency to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you can add double your proficiency to the damage roll.</li>
<li><strong>Lightning Baton.</strong> You create a magical baton that channels lightning. You have proficiency in this weapon. It has the Finesse and Light properties. It deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage and 1d4 lightning damage on hit.</li>
<li><strong>Smoke Bomb.</strong> As an action, you can use this to cast <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=303">Fog Cloud</a> centered on yourself without expending a spell slot. It lasts a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier and does not require concentration. You have a number of smoke bombs equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can regain expended uses when you finish a short rest.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extra Attack</h2>
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
<h2>Gadget Upgrade</h2>
Starting at 9th level, you've mastered the essential tools, and have begun to tinker with ways to expand your arsenal. Choose one of the following upgrades.
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Baton.</strong> You upgrade your baton with additional lightning capabilities. When you get a critical hit with this weapon, the target must succeed a Constitution saving throw against your Spell Save DC or become stunned until the start of your next turn. You can make a DC 10 Intelligence (Medicine) to revive an unconscious companion with your baton. If you succeed, they regain 1 hit point and a number of temporary hit points equal to your Artificer level, but they gain 1 level of exhaustion.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Boomerang.</strong> Once per turn, when you take the Attack action with your boomerang of hitting and have advantage on an attack, you can forgo advantage on an attack to make one additional weapon attack (also without advantage) with this weapon against one other target within 10 feet of another target as a bonus action.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Gauntlet.</strong> Your impact gauntlets can exert massive force when striking. When you make an attack with your gauntlet, you can use a bonus action to move 10 feet backwards, or force a Medium or smaller target to make a Strength saving throw or be knocked 10 feet backwards.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Grappling Hook.</strong> You enhance your grappling hook, increasing its range to 30 feet. Additionally, the enhanced power of the grappling hook means that when pulling yourself to a large or larger creature or object, you can drag one medium or smaller willing or grappled creature within 5 feet of you with you.</li>
<li><strong>Vanishing Trick.</strong> When you use a Smoke Bomb you can use a bonus action to cast <a href="../../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=523">Misty Step</a> without expending a spell slot. Once you do this, you cannot do this again until you complete a short or long rest.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recycle Upgrades</h2>
At 9th level, during the course of a long rest, you can disassemble your upgrades and create different ones. When you do this, remove the upgrade from your Gadget Upgrade feature and pick a new upgrade its place.
<h2>Combat Gadgets</h2>
Beginning at the 15th level, when you take the Attack action, you can replace one attack with using any gadget or Artificer Infusion that requires an action to use.
