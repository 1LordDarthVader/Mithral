<h1>Timethief Specialization</h1>

For those that pursue the magic of artifice, no area of study is too dangerous. Perhaps against their better judgment, some artificers choose to experiment with Chronomancy, the magic of time. Known as a Timethief, these bold artificers are marked by their signature Unwinding Clocks, a wondrous object which they use to steal moments of time.

<h2>Tool Proficiency</h2>
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with horologist's tools. If you are already proficient with horologist's tools, you gain proficiency with another set of artisan's tools of your choice.

<h2>Timethief Spells</h2>
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Timethief Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

<h2>Unwinding Clock</h2>
At 3rd level, at the end of a long rest, you can use your jeweler's tools to construct an Unwinding Clock. This is can be a watch, hourglass, or small sun dial, which can be used as a spellcasting focus by you for your artificer spells.

<br><br>You can only have one Clock at a time, and creating another causes the magic within the first to dissipate.

<br><br>Your Clock has a number of charges equal to twice your Intelligence modifier. It regains all expended charges when you finish a long rest. While your Chronometer is in hand, you can expend a charge to use the following abilities:

<br><br><strong>Accelerate.</strong> As an action, you increase the speed of a creature within 60 feet by a number feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier until the end of their next turn.
<br><br><strong>Decelerate.</strong> As an action, you force a creature that within 60 feet to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, its movement speed is reduced by a number feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier until the end of its next turn.
<br><br><strong>Slip.</strong> As a reaction when a creature within 60 feet makes an attack roll or ability check, you can force them to have disadvantage on the roll.
<br><br><strong>Warp.</strong> As an action, you can switch places with a creature within 60 feet, each instantly teleporting to the other's space. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be forced to switch places with you.

<h2>Stolen Moments</h2>
Beginning at 5th level, you gain a bonus to your damage rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) on creatures that are paralyzed, stunned, or has their movement speed reduced to 0.

<br><br>Also, any of your Unwinding Clock abilities that require an action to use can also be used as a bonus action on your turn.

<h2>Empowered Chronomancy</h2>
At 9th level in this class, the magic of your Unwinding Clock improves in the following ways:

<br><br><strong>Accelerate.</strong> Opportunity attacks against the target creature have disadvantage until the end of their next turn.
<br><br><strong>Decelerate.</strong> You can spend an additional charge to double the movement speed reduction. If this feature reduces a target's speed to 0, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
<br><br><strong>Slip.</strong> You can spend two charges to use this reaction after the creature makes its attack roll or ability check, but before the DM determines whether the roll succeeds or fails, and force them to reroll it.
<br><br><strong>Warp.</strong> You can spend additional charges to increase the range by an additional 30 feet for each extra charge you expend.

<h2>Master Timethief</h2>
Starting at 15th level, when you successfully paralyze, stun, or reduce a creature's movement speed to 0 with a spell or Timethief ability, your Unwinding Clock regains one of its expended charges.

<br><br>Also, you can overload your Unwinding Clock to cast time stop, expending any remaining charges. When you do so this way, you instead take extra turns equal to half the number of charges expended (rounded up).

<br><br>Once you cast time stop in this way, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.
