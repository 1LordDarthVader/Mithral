<h1>Infusions</h1>


<p>Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item. The description of each of the following infusions details the type of object that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.</p>
<p>Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can't learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.</p>
<p>Unless an infusion's description says otherwise, you can't learn an infusion more than once.</p>
<h1 id="toc0"><span>Arcane Propulsion Armor</span></h1>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 14th-level artificer</em><br>
<strong>Item:</strong> A suit of armor (requires attunement)</p>
<p>The wearer of this armor gains these benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The wearer gains a +1 bonus to AC.</li>
<li>The wearer's walking speed increases by 10 feet.</li>
<li>If the wearer is missing any limbs, the armor replaces those limbs - hands, arms, feet, legs, or similar appendages. The replacements function identically to the body parts they replace.</li>
<li>The wearer has a flying speed equal to their walking speed. The wearer falls if they end their turn in the air and nothing else is holding them aloft.</li>
<li>If the wearer flies at least 20 feet in a straight line towards a target and makes a melee attack against it, the target is pushed back 10 feet and takes an extra 1d8 force damage.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="toc1"><span>Armor of Magical Strength</span></h1>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> A suit of armor (requires attunement)</p>
<p>This armor has 6 charges. The wearer can expend the armor's charges in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the creature would be knocked prone, it can use its reaction to expend 1 charge to avoid being knocked prone.</li>
</ul>
<p>The armor regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p>In addition, when the wearer makes a Strength check or a Strength saving throw, it can use its Intelligence modifier in place of its Strength modifier.</p>
<h1 id="toc2"><span>Armor of Tools</span></h1>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> A suit of armor</p>
<p>As an action, a creature wearing this infused armor can integrate into it artisan's tools or thieves' tools. The tools remain integrated in the armor for 8 hours or until the wearer removes the tools as an action. The armor can have only one tool integrated at a time. The wearer can add its Intelligence modifier to any ability checks it makes with the integrated tool. The wearer must have a hand free to use the tool.</p>
<h1 id="toc3"><span>Boots of the Winding Path</span></h1>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 6th-level artificer</em><br>
<strong>Item:</strong> A pair of boots (requires attunement)</p>
<p>While wearing these boots, a creature can teleport up to 15 feet as a bonus action to an unoccupied space the creature can see. The creature must have occupied that space at some point during the current turn.</p>
<h1 id="toc4"><span>Enhanced Arcane Focus</span></h1>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> A rod, staff or wand (requires attunement)</p>
<p>While holding this item, a creature gains +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, the creature ignores half cover when making a spell attack.</p>
<p>The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.</p>
<h1 id="toc5"><span>Enhanced Defense</span></h1>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> A suit of armor or a shield</p>
<p>A creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class while wearing (armor) or wielding (shield) the infused item.</p>
<p>The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.</p>
<h1 id="toc6"><span>Enhanced Weapon</span></h1>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> A simple or martial weapon</p>
<p>This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>
<p>The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.</p>
<h1 id="toc7"><span>Helm of Awareness</span></h1>
<p><em>Prerequisite: 10th-level artificer</em><br>
<strong>Item:</strong> A helmet (requires attunement)</p>
<p>While wearing this helmet, a creature has advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the wearer can't be surprised, provided it isn't incapacitated.</p>
<h1 id="toc8"><span>Homunculus Servant</span></h1>
<p><strong>Item:</strong> A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp</p>
<p>You learn intricate methods for magically creating a special homunculus that serves you. The item you infuse serves as the creature's heart, around which the creature's body instantly forms.</p>
<p>You determine the homunculus's appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.</p>
<p>The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p>
<p>In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>
<p>The homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it. If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its heart in its space.</p>
