    <h1>Called Shots</h1>
    Practice makes perfect, and with extensive practice you've mastered the art of hitting even smaller targets. Before making an attack with a ranged weapon with which you are proficient, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you successfully land a shot on a specific part of the creature. If applicable, the following locations can be hit, with corresponding effects. The saving throw DC for these effects are equal to 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus and whichever ability score modifier you used to make the attack roll.
<ul>
<li><strong>Head.</strong> The target must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Torso.</strong> You increase your critical range for this attack by 1.</li>
<li><strong>Arms.</strong> Choose one of the creature's arms. The target creature must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or drop whatever is in that arm, knocking the item 10ft. away from you.</li>
<li><strong>Legs.</strong> The target creature must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or fall prone. Large and larger creatures make this save with advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Wings.</strong> The target creature must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or plummet 20ft. Undead and constructs are immune to this effect.</li>
</ul>
