    <h1>Artificer Initiate</h1>
    You’ve learned some of an artificer’s inventiveness:
<ul>
<li>You learn one cantrip of your choice from the artificer spell list, and you learn one 1st-level spell of your choice from that list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</li>
<li>You can cast this feat's 1st-level spell without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.</li>
<li>You gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice, and you can use that type of tool as a spellcasting focus for any spell you cast that uses Intelligence as its spellcasting ability. In addition, your proficiency bonus is doubled for checks made with the chosen tool.</li>
</ul>
