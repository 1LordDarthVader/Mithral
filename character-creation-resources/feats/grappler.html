    <h1>Grappler</h1>
    <em>Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher</em><br />
You've developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.</li>
<li>A creature you are grappling has disadvantage on attack rolls against any creature other than you.</li>
<li>You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, the creature is restrained until the grapple ends. You can only have one creature pinned at a time.</li>
</ul>
