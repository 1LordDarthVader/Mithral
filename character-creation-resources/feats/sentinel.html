    <h1>Sentinel</h1>
    You have mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy's guard, gaining the following benefits.
<ul>
<li>When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.</li>
<li>Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.</li>
<li>When a creature makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.</li>
</ul>
