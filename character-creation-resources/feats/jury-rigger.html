    <h1>Jury Rigger</h1>
    Guns can be fickle. They jam, break, and sometimes are plain out to get you. You've seen it all, and know how to whip your firearm back into shape at a moment's notice. You gain the following benefits.
<ul>
<li>Increase your Strength or Intelligence by 1, to a maximum of 20</li>
<li>When using a firearm with a misfire die of d4 or lower, treat it as a d6. Additionally, when rolling the misfire die before an attack roll with a jammed firearm, you may use your bonus action to reroll it.</li>
<li>You may swap attachments on your firearm over the course of 1 minute with a successful Tinker's Tools check. You may also modify your firearm's main parts in half the time, to a minimum of a short rest.</li>
</ul>
