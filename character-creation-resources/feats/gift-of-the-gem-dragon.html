    <h1>Gift of the Gem Dragon</h1>
    You’ve manifested some of the power of gem dragons, granting you the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
<li>When you take damage from a creature that is within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to emanate telekinetic energy. The creature that dealt damage to you must make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat). On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 force damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</li>
</ul>
