    <h1>Defensive Duelist</h1>
    <em>Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher</em><br>
When you are wielding a finesse weapon with which you are proficient and another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.
