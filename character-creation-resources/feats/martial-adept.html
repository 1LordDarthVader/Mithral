    <h1>Martial Adept</h1>
    You have martial training that allows you to perform special combat maneuvers. You gain the following benefits.
<ul>
    <li>You learn two <a href="../classes/fighter/exploit-list.html">Martial Exploits</a> of your choice from among those available to the fighter class. If an exploit you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the exploit's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).</li>
<li>You gain one exploit die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any exploit dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your exploits. A exploit die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended exploit dice when you finish a short or long rest.</li>
</ul>
You can take this feat multiple times, and gain additional exploit dice and exploit options each time.
