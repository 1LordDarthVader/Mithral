    <h1>Crusher</h1>
    You are practiced in the art of crushing your enemies, granting you the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Increase your Strength or Constitution by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
<li>Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack that deals bludgeoning damage, you can move it 5 feet to an unoccupied space, provided the target is no more than one size larger than you.</li>
<li>When you score a critical hit that deals bludgeoning damage to a creature, attack rolls against that creature are made with advantage until the start of your next turn.</li>
</ul>
