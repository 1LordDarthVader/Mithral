    <h1>Mud Lover, Ground Hitter</h1>
    You are very accustomed to being shot at and to hitting the deck in an emergency. Unfortunately for you, cover is always a bit too far away. You gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Increase your Dexterity or Constitution by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
<li>When you are targeted by a ranged weapon attack, you may use your reaction to drop prone.</li>
<li>Being prone does not impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attacks.</li>
<li>While prone, your speed increases by 10 feet.</li>
</ul>
