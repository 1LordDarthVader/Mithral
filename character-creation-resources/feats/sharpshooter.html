    <h1>Sharpshooter</h1>
    You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.</li>
<li>Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.</li>
<li>Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If that attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.</li>
</ul>
