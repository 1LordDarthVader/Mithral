    <h1>Gunslinger</h1>
    Known for having the fastest hands in the West, East, North, South, or anywhere in between. Your lighting reflexes drop foes in a flurry of gunpowder before they even know what hit them. You gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>You may add your proficiency bonus to your initiative, or again if you already do so.</li>
<li>As part of your weapon attacks, you may draw the weapon if it is stowed.</li>
<li>You have advantage on ability checks to notice concealed weapons on another creature.</li>
<li>You may use your reaction to make a weapon attack against another creature that has not yet taken its turn in combat. This attack is at disadvantage unless you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the attack is a ranged weapon attack, it cannot exceed the weapon's normal range.</li>
</ul>
