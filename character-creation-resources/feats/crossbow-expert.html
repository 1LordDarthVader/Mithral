    <h1>Crossbow Expert</h1>
    Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>You ignore the loading quality of crossbows with which you are proficient.</li>
<li>Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.</li>
<li>When you use the Attack action and attack with a one handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a hand crossbow you are holding.</li>
</ul>
