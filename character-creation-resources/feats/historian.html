    <h1>Historian</h1>
    Your study of history rewards you with the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You gain proficiency in the History skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When you take the Help action to aid another creature's ability check, you can make a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. On a success, that creature's check gains a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus, as you share pertinent advice and historical examples. To receive this bonus, the creature must be able to understand what you're saying.</li>
</ul>
