    <h1>Outlaw</h1>
    Nothing beats the smell of gunpowder in the moments after blasting away a foe. You gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you may take the Reload action as a Bonus Action until the end of your turn.</li>
<li>When when you score a critical hit with a firearm, you may automatically reload up to 2 rounds, consuming ammo as normal.</li>
<li>As an action, you can make as many attacks as ammunition left in the magazine of a one-handed cylinder-action firearm that you are proficient with. These attacks are always at disadvantage and cannot exceed the firearm's normal range.</li>
<li>Lever-Action firearms that are light are considered to be one-handed for you.</li>
</ul>
