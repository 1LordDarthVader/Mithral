    <h1>Mobile</h1>
    You are exceptionally speedy and agile. You gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Your speed increases by 10 feet.</li>
<li>When you use the Dash action, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement on that turn.</li>
<li>When you make a melee attack against a creature, you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn, whether you hit or not.</li>
</ul>
