    <h1>Pistolero</h1>
    You've honed your skill of aiming two weapons at the same time. You gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>When you take the Attack action and attack with a ranged weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different ranged weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You may add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack.</li>
<li>You can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.</li>
<li>You can take the Reload action to reload two light, one-handed firearms in each of your hands at once.</li>
</ul>
