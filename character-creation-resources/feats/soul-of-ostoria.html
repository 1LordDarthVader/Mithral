<h1>Soul of Ostoria</h1>

<em>Prerequisite: 4th level</em><br>

You've manifested the magic of giants, granting you benefits based on your chosen type of giant:

<h2>Ember of the Fire Giant</h2>

You've manifested the fiery combat emblematic of fire giants.<br><br>

<strong>Born of Flame.</strong> You have resistance to fire damage.<br><br>
<strong>Searing Ignition.</strong> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a magical burst of flame. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you that can see you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage equal to 2d6 + your proficiency bonus and is blinded until the start of your next turn; on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects. You can use your Searing Ignition a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Fury of the Frost Giant</h2>

You've manifested the icy might emblematic of frost giants.

<br><br><strong>Born of Ice.</strong> You have resistance to cold damage.
<br><br><strong>Frigid Vengeance.</strong> When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to retaliate with a burst of magical ire. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or be frightened of you until the start of its next turn. You can use your reaction in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

<h2>Guile of the Cloud Giant</h2>

You've manifested the airy speech and magic emblematic of cloud giants.

<br><br><strong>Misty Form.</strong> You can cast the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=92">Blur</a> spell without using a spell slot or material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the spell doesn't require you to maintain concentration on it. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast this spell in the normal way using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this feature (choose when you gain this feat).
<br><br><strong>Silver Tongue.</strong> You gain proficiency in either the Deception or Persuasion skill. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using this skill.

<h2>Keenness of the Stone Giant</h2>

You've manifested the protection and spellcasting emblematic of stone giants.

<br><br><strong>Dreamer's Magic.</strong> You learn the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=205">Detect Thoughts</a> spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the abjuration or the divination school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this feature (choose when you gain this feat).
<br><br><strong>Mountain Sight.</strong> You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from another source, its range increases by 30 feet.

<h2>Sight of the Storm Giant</h2>

You've manifested divination abilities and tempest magic emblematic of storm giants.

<br><br><strong>Maelstrom Aura.</strong> As a bonus action, you surround yourself in an aura of magical wind and lightning that extends 10 feet from you in every direction but not through total cover. The aura lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. While the aura is active, attack rolls against you have disadvantage, and whenever a creature starts its turn within the sphere, you can force the creature's speed to be halved until the start of its next turn. Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
<br><br><strong>Storm's Oracle.</strong> You can cast the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=218">Divination</a> spell as a ritual, without needing material components. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this feature (choose when you gain this feat). Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

<h2>Vigor of the Hill Giant</h2>

You've manifested the resilience emblematic of hill giants.

<br><br><strong>Bulwark.</strong> When you are subjected to an effect that would move you at least 5 feet or knock you prone, you can use your reaction to steady yourself. You are then neither moved nor knocked prone.
<br><br><strong>Hearty Health.</strong> When you are subjected to a spell that restores your hit points, you can regain additional hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. You can regain these additional hit points a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
