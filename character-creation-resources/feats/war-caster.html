    <h1>War Caster</h1>
    <em>Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell</em><br>
You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell when you take damage.</li>
<li>You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.</li>
<li>When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature.</li>
</ul>
