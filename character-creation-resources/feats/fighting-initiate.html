    <h1>Fighting Initiate</h1>
    <em>Prerequisite: Proficiency with a martial weapon</em><br>
Your martial training has helped you develop a particular style of fighting. As a result, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
<li>You learn one Fighting Style option of your choice from the Fighter class. If you already have a style, the one you choose must be different.</li>
</ul>
Whenever you reach a level that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace this feat's fighting style with another one from the fighter class that you don't have.
