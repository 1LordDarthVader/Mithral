    <h1>Fey Touched</h1>
    Your exposure to the Feywild's magic has changed you, granting you the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
    <li>You learn the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=523">Misty Step</a> spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the <a href="../spells/schools/divination.html">Divination</a> or <a href="../spells/schools/enchantment.html">Enchantment</a> school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can’t cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells’ spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.</li>
</ul>
