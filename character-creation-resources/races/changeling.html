        <h1>Changeling</h1>
        Changelings can shift their forms with a thought. Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression. It's also an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion.
<h2>Changeling Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Charisma score increases by 2. In addition, one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> Changelings mature slightly faster than humans but share a similar lifespan — typically a century or less. While a changeling can transform to conceal their age, the effects of aging affect them similarly to humans.
<br><br><strong>Alignment.</strong> Changelings tend toward pragmatic neutrality, and few changelings embrace evil.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> In their natural forms, changelings average between 5 to 6 feet in height, with a slender build. Your size is Medium.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Shapechanger.</strong> As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight, but not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can't duplicate the appearance of a creature you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren't changed by this trait.
<br><br>You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die.
<br><br><strong>Changeling Instincts.</strong> You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, and Persuasion.
<br><br><strong>Divergent Persona.</strong> You gain proficiency with one tool of your choice. Define a unique identity associated with that proficiency; establish the name, race, gender, age, and other details. While you are in the form of this persona, the related proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses that proficiency.
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice.
<h2>Racial Feats</h2>
<h3>Adaptive Shapechange</h3>
Your shapechanging abilities are particularly refined, and allow you to adapt to your environment. You can cast the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=17">Alter Self</a> spell. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.
<br><br>You can cast the spell in this way once, and regain the ability to do so after you finish a short or long rest.
