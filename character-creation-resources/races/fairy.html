        <h1>Fairy</h1>
        The Feywild is home to many fantastic peoples, including fairies. Fairies are a wee folk, but not nearly as much so as their pixie and sprite friends. The first fairies spoke Elvish, Goblin, or Sylvan, and encounters with human visitors prompted many of them to learn Common as well.
<br><br>Infused with the magic of the Feywild, most fairies look like Small elves with insectile wings, but each fairy has a special physical characteristic that sets the fairy apart. For your fairy, roll on the Fey Characteristics table or choose an option from it. You're also free to come up with your own characteristic if none of the suggestions below fit your character.

<h2>Fairy Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Charisma score increases by 2 and your Dexterity score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Alignment.</strong> Fairies, like most fey, tend towards chaos.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> Fairies reach maturity around the age of 10 and have a life span of about a century.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Fairies range between a few inches and a foot tall. Your size is tiny.
<ul>
<li>Tiny creatures cannot use weapons with the heavy property</li>
<li>All weapons used by Tiny creatures have the size of their damage dice reduced by one step.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
<br><br><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong> Your creature type is fey, rather than humanoid. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
<br><br><strong>Fairy Magic.</strong> You know the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=235">Druidcraft</a> cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=273">Faerie Fire</a> spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=258">Enlarge/Reduce</a> spell with this trait. Once you cast Faerie Fire or Enlarge/Reduce with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait.
<br><br><strong>Flight.</strong> Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor.
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.
<h2>Racial Feats</h2>
<h3>Quickling Blood</h3>
You have traces of quickling blood in your veins, allowing you to make your position imprecise. You can cast the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=92">Blur</a> spell. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it. You can cast it in this way once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
<h3>Pixie Blood</h3>
You have traces of pixie blood in your veins, allowing you to make yourself invisible. You can cast the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=442">Invisibility</a> spell. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it. You can cast it in this way once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
<h3>Sprite Blood</h3>
You have traces of sprite blood in your veins, allowing you to determine the attitudes of others. As an action, you can touch a creature and force them to make a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed saving throw, you learn the target's alignment and its bonds, ideals, and flaws.
You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.
