        <h1>Thri-Kreen</h1>
        Thri-kreen have insectile features and two pairs of arms. Their bodies are encased in protective chitin. They can alter the coloration of this carapace to blend in with their natural surroundings.
<br><br>Although thri-kreen don't sleep, they do require periods of inactivity to revitalize themselves. During these periods, they are fully conscious and aware of what's happening around them.
<br><br>Thri-kreen speak by clacking their mandibles and waving their antennae, indicating to other thri-kreen what they are thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this method of communication difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate. To interact with other folk, thri-kreen rely on a form of telepathy.
<h2>Thri-Kreen Traits</h2>
        <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores increase by 1.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Thri-kreen range in size from 4 and a half to 7 feet. Your size is Medium.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Chameleon Carapace.</strong> While you aren't wearing armor, your carapace gives you a base Armor Class of 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.
        <br><br>
        In addition, as an action, you can change the color of your carapace to match the color and texture of your surroundings, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in those surroundings.
<br><br><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.
<br><br><strong>Secondary Arms.</strong> You have two slightly smaller secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. The secondary arms function like your primary arms, with the following exceptions:
<ul>
<li>You can use a secondary arm to wield a weapon that has the light property, but you can't use a secondary arm to wield other kinds of weapons.</li>
<li>You can't wield a shield with a secondary arm</li>
</ul>
<strong>Sleepless Revitalization.</strong> You do not require sleep and can choose to remain conscious during a long rest, though you must still refrain from strenuous activity to gain the benefit of the rest.
<br><br><strong>Thri-kreen Telepathy.</strong> You have the magical ability to communicate mentally with any number of willing creatures you can see within 120 feet of you. A contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with you, but it must be able to understand at least one language. Your telepathic link to a creature is broken if you and the creature move more than 120 feet apart, if either of you is incapacitated, or if either of you mentally breaks the contact (no action required).
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Thri-kreen.
<h2>Racial Feats</h2>
<h3>Paralyzing Venom</h3>
Your mandibles have developed enough to be used as weapons, and you have developed a paralyzing poison. Your bite is a natural weapon that deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.
<br><br>If you hit a creature with your bite attack, you can force them to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed saving throw, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
<br><br>Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
