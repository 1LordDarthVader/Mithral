        <h1>Panserbjorn</h1>
        Historically solitary and primitive in nature, panserbjørn have, under recent leadership, begun forming increasing- ly larger communities. This burgeoning civilisation has begun adopting social norms and morals much closer to those found within ‘civilised’ cultures. Indeed, magi- cal universities now include panserbjørn amongst their alumni, and remote mountain-top temples highly prize these bear-people as monks and clerics. Even the more solitary panserbjørn are sought after as guides for trad- ing caravans or adventurers delving into the tundra.
<h2>Panserbjørn Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Constitution and Strength scores increase by 1.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> Panserbjørn mature at the same rate humans do, and are expected to become independent in their mid-teens. They can live to 80 years.
<br><br><strong>Alignment.</strong> Panserbjørn, by nature, care mostly about their own survival, and tend towards neutral alignments. Wild pansebjørn gravitate towards chaos and value their freedom above all else. Cultured panserbjørn, conversely, lean towards lawful habits, seeking to become a member of wider civilised society.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Panserbjørn are over 7 feet tall, when erect, and average in excess of 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Ursine Claws.</strong> Your claws are as long as a child’s hand, and a natural weapon you can use to make unarmed attacks. If you hit with them you deal slashing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage for an unarmed strike. In addition, if you are not wearing footwear, you can move across non-magical difficult terrain made of ice and snow without expending additional movement.
<br><br><strong>Olfactory Hunter.</strong> You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
<br><br><strong>Forgers of Sky-Iron.</strong> You have proficiency with smith’s tools and craft a bespoke suit of armor, as important to you as your own soul. This magical armor can be enchanted and is not destroyed by disenchantment.
<br><br>Whenever an increase to your proficiency bonus would lead to an increase in your AC, you must purchase sky-iron with a gold cost of 100 x your character level and spend 8 hours at a forge in order to gain this benefit.
<br><br>You tailor this metal to the armor style with which you are proficient:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Armor Type</th>
<th>AC</th>

<td>Heavy</td>
<td>16 + half your proficiency bonus (rounded down)</td>
</tr>

<li>As long as you otherwise eat at normal levels, you can go for up to three months without food.</li>
