        <h1>Firbolg</h1>
        Firbolgs are fey-oriented half-giants. Their tribes cloister in remote forest strongholds, preferring to spend their days in quiet harmony with the woods. When provoked, firbolgs demonstrate formidable skills with weapons and druidic magic.
<h2>Firbolg Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> As humanoids related to the fey, firbolg have long lifespans. A firbolg reaches adulthood around 30, and the oldest of them can live for 500 years.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Firbolg are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 240 and 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Firbolg Magic.</strong> You can cast <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=203">Detect Magic</a> and <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=210">Disguise Self</a> with this trait, using Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for them. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it again with this trait until you finish a short or long rest. When you use this version of disguise self, you can seem up to 3 feet shorter than normal, allowing you to more easily blend in with humans and elves.

<br><br><strong>Powerful Build.</strong> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
<br><br><strong>Speech of Beast and Leaf.</strong> You have the ability to communicate in a limited manner with beasts and plants. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them.
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Giant, and Sylvan.
<h2>Racial Feats</h2>
<h3>Firbolg Beast Magic</h3>
Your connection to animals deepens. You learn the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=701">Speak With Animals</a> spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=23">Animal Friendship</a> and <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=68">Beast Sense</a> spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
