        <h1>Kobold</h1>
        Kobolds are often dismissed as cowardly, foolish, and weak, but these little reptilian creatures actually have a strong social structure that stresses devotion to the tribe, are clever with their hands, and viciously work together in order to overcome their physical limitations.
<h2>Kobold Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> Kobolds reach adulthood at age 6 and can live up to 120 years but rarely do so.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Kobolds are between 2 and 3 feet tall and weigh between 25 and 35 pounds. Your size is Small.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
<br><br><strong>Distraction.</strong> As an action on your turn, you can distract nearby foes. Until the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against enemies within 10 feet of you that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<br><br><strong>Pack Tactics.</strong> You have advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
<br><br><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity.</strong> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.
<h2>Variants</h2>
<h3>Draconic Kobold</h3>
As a draconic kobold, the following traits replace your Distraction, Pack Tactics, and Sunlight Sensitivity traits.
<br><br><strong>Draconic Legacy.</strong> The kobold connection to dragons can manifest in unpredictable ways in an individual kobold. Choose one of the following legacy options when you select this race:
<ul>
<li>You have advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the frightened condition on yourself.</li>
<li>You know one cantrip of your choice from the arcane spell list. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for that cantrip.</li>
<li>You can make unarmed strikes with your tail. When you hit with it, the strike deals 1d8 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</li>
</ul>
<br><br><strong>Draconic Roar.</strong> As a bonus action, you let out a draconic roar at your enemies within 10 feet of you. Until the end of your next turn, you and your allies have advantage on attack rolls against any of those enemies who could hear the roar. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<h2>Racial Feats</h2>
<h3>Urd Wings</h3>
You manifest leathery wings, transforming into an urd. You gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
<li>You gain a flying speed of 30 feet.</li>
</ul>
