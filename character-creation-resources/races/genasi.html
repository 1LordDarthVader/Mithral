        <h1>Genasi</h1>
        Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.
<h2>Genasi Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.
<br><br><strong>Alignment.</strong> Independent and self-reliant, genasi tend toward a neutral alignment.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like humans, standing anywhere from 5 feet to over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
