<h2>Subraces</h2>
<h3>Cloud Goliath</h3>
A cloud goliath prefers physical distance from other creatures, and have reputations for paying little heed to the plights of the world.
<br><br>Cloud goliaths have an innate attunement to the magic of their forefathers' airy domain. Many even follow the cloud giant god, Memnor, renowned by the good for his foresight and eloquent speech, and simultaneously praised by the evil who emulate his arrogance and vanity.
<br><br><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Atmospheric Arcana.</strong> You know the Misty Step spell once with this trait. You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them.
<br><br><strong>Gentle Descent.</strong> At the end of a fall, you only take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 20 feet you fall, rather than every 10 feet. In addition, you do not land prone, even if you take damage from the fall.
<h3>Fire Goliath</h3>
As a member of the fire goliath, you find comfort by the heat of the forge or in warm, even volcanic environments.
<br><br>Fire giants are known to be a militaristic race, and their goliath descendants are no different. Formal martial training and a strict hierarchy of leadership are integral aspects of fire goliath society. Fire goliaths also have a rich tradition of storytelling through singing tales of great battles past.
<br><br><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Legacy of War.</strong> You learn one martial exploit from those available to the Fighter class and can use it once with this trait. For the purposes of using the exploit, your Exploit Die is a d4.
<br><br>If the exploit requires your target to make a saving throw to resist its effects, the saving throw DC is 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus. You regain the use of your exploit when you finish a short or long rest.
<br><br><strong>Master Metallurgist.</strong> You have proficiency with smith's tools.
<br><br><strong>Heat of the Forge.</strong> You have resistance to fire damage. You’re also acclimated to extreme heat.
<h3>Frost Goliath</h3>
Frost goliaths are fierce and hardy in battle, and they take pride in their scars and grisly trophies taken from their fallen enemies, which they fashion into armor, weapons, and jewelry.
<br><br>Frost goliaths respect brute strength above all, and as such, routine challenges of leadership are a regular part of their culture as they wrestle to exert their dominance.
<br><br><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Glacial Fortitude.</strong> When you fail a Constitution saving throw, you can reroll the save and must use the new roll. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
<br><br><strong>Tanner.</strong> You have proficiency with leatherworker's tools.
<br><br><strong>Arctic Born.</strong> You have resistance to cold damage. You’re also acclimated to extreme cold.
<h3>Golyclops</h3>
Golyclopses are derived from cyclopes. Legend says that cyclopes are derived from a line of giants who had their eyes plucked out by their god, Grolantor, and replaced with one large eye in the center of their forehead.
<br><br>Their reliance on a single, powerful eye hinders their ability to discern distance, but it has also granted them a supernatural ability to see through illusory magics and overcome effects that would sear the oculi of most humanoids.
<br><br><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Depth Impaired.</strong> You have disadvantage on any ranged attack at a range greater than 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Retinal Resilience.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being blinded.
<br><br><strong>All-Seeing Eye.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against illusions.
<br><br>In addition, whenever you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern whether something within 30 feet of you is an illusion, you can use this trait to automatically succeed on the check. Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
<br><br><strong>Grotesque Coercion.</strong> You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.
<h3>Hill Goliath</h3>
Hill goliaths have a tendency to doze off in broad daylight atop whatever hill they find themselves on. They are prone to fits of violent destruction, especially when they realize someone has tried to deceive them or make a fool of them.
<br><br><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Superior Slumber.</strong> When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended hit dice, rather than half.
<br><br><strong>Rampage.</strong> As a bonus action, you can go on a rampage, which lasts until the start of your next turn. While on a rampage, when you roll damage for a melee weapon attack using Strength, your Strength modifier is doubled.
<br><br>Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<h3>Stone Goliath</h3>
At the highest mountain peaks dwell the reclusive stone goliaths, wandering a bleak realm of rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are carved from mountain stone and give them great physical power. Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each goliath with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying.
<br><br><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Natural Athlete.</strong> You have proficiency in the Athletics skill.
<br><br><strong>Stone's Endurance.</strong> You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<br><br><strong>Mountain Born.</strong> You have resistance to cold damage. You’re also acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet.
<h3>Storm Goliath</h3>
Goliaths with storm ancestry believe that storm giants were too proud to willingly create lesser, humanoid offspring and too powerful to be forced to, so they were magically subdued and had their blood stolen.
<br><br>Storm goliaths prefer a life of isolation where they contemplate the events of the world - past, present, and future - as well as the meaning of their existence. Still, the rich history of prophecies and omens drives many to a life of adventure, seeking out truth and answers.
<br><br><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Storm Strike.</strong> You know the Zap cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
<br><br><strong>Tempestuous Resilience.</strong> You have resistance to lightning damage.
<h2>Racial Feats</h2>
<h3>Giant's Soul</h3>
You possess more abilities from your ancestral giants. You learn a 1st level spell determined by your subrace. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for it.
