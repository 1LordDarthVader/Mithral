        <h1>Viashino</h1>
        Many reptiles derive their body warmth and energy from the sun, but the humanoid viashino are fueled by an inner fire of zeal. Open with their emotions, viashino can be hot-tempered, but they are also quick to their hissing laughter, and they easily form close bonds of friendship. They are fierce warriors and passionate advocates for their guilds and causes.
<h2>Viashino Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> Viashino mature quickly, reaching adulthood in their early teens. They live violent lives and rarely die of old age, but they would rarely live past 60 anyway.
<br><br><strong>Alignment.</strong> Viashino strongly tend toward chaotic alignments. They have no particular inclination toward good or evil.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Viashino are about as tall as humans, but they have lithe, wiry frames. Your size is Medium.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 35 feet.
<br><br><strong>Lashing Tail.</strong> Your semi-prehensile tail is tipped with a bony blade. Immediately after a creature within 5 feet of you deals damage to you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make an unarmed strike against that creature with your tail. If you hit, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
<br><br><strong>Vicious Attacks.</strong> When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.
<br><br><strong>Wiry Frame.</strong> You gain proficiency in the Acrobatics or the Stealth skill (your choice).
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.
