<h1>Mousefolk</h1>
The life of the Mousefolk is one spent close to the ground.  With no great empires or kingdoms to call home, the Mousefolk spend their lives carving a place for themselves in the cities of the larger races or in the untamed wilds.  They form tight-knit communities where every member is expected to contribute to the success of the whole.  Some Mousefolk study a trade skill to support their families, while others use their natural agility and intellect for contract services.

A reverence for nature and life is close to the heart of Mousefolk, and they loath to take a life if it can be avoided.
