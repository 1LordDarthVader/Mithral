        <h1>Warforged</h1>
        The warforged were built to fight. The first warforged were mindless automatons, but their creators devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced fully sentient soldiers, blending organic and inorganic materials. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killing machine, or a visionary in search of purpose and meaning.
<h2>Warforged Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> A typical warforged is between two and thirty years old. The maximum lifespan of the warforged remains a mystery; so far, warforged have shown no signs of deterioration due to age.
<br><br><strong>Alignment.</strong> Most warforged take comfort in order and discipline, tending toward law and neutrality. But some have absorbed the morality - or lack thereof - of the beings with which they served.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Your size is Medium. Most warforged stand between 5 and 6&#160;1/2 feet tall. Weight and build are affected by subrace.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Warforged Resilience.</strong> You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits.
<ul>
<li>You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.</li>
<li>You are immune to disease.</li>
<li>You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.</li>
<li>You don't need to sleep and don't suffer the effects of exhaustion due to lack of rest, and magic can't put you to sleep.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Sentry's Rest.</strong> When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn't render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.
<br><br><strong>Integrated Protection.</strong> Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor.
<ul>
<li>You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.</li>
<li>You can don only armor with which you have proficiency. To don armor, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you must remain in contact with the armor. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while donning or doffing armor in this way.</li>
<li>While you live, your armor can't be removed from your body against your will.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Subraces</h2>
<h3>Envoy</h3>

<h3>Juggernaut</h3>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2.
<br><br><strong>Iron Fists.</strong> When you make an unarmed strike, you can deal 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage instead of the normal damage.

<h2>Racial Feats</h2>
<h3>Warforged Resolve</h3>
You gain 3 points of Resolve. You can expend resolve to power the following features:
<ul>
<li>When you make a death saving throw and fail, you may spend a point of Resolve to ignore it.</li>
<li>When you would make a Wisdom saving throw but before you do so, you may spend a point of Resolve and make a Constitution saving throw instead.</li>
<li>When you make a Constitution saving throw but before being told the outcome of your roll, you may spend a point of Resolve and roll one more time. You must take the new roll.</li>
</ul>
You regain all expended Resolve points when you finish a long rest.
