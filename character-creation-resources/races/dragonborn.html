        <h1>Dragonborn</h1>
        The dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids.
<h2>Dragonborn Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength, Constitution, and Charisma scores increase by 1.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Breath Weapon.</strong> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).
<br><br>You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
<br><br>The type of saving throw and damage are determined by your subrace.
<br><br><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
<br><br><strong>Natural Armor.</strong> You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.
<h2>Draconblood Variant</h2>
As a draconblood, the following trait replaces your Natural Armor trait.
<br><br><strong>Forceful Presence.</strong> When you make a Intimidation or Persuasion check, you can do so with advantage once per short or long rest.
<h2>Pureblood Chromatic Variant</h2>
As a pureblood chromatic, the following trait replaces your Natural Armor trait. You must choose a chromatic subrace.
<br><br><strong>Chromatic Warding.</strong> Starting at 5th level, as an action, you can channel your draconic energy to protect yourself. For 1 minute, you become immune to the damage type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Pureblood Gem Variant</h2>
As a pureblood gem, the following traits replace your Natural Armor trait. You must choose a gem subrace.
<br><br><strong>Psionic Mind.</strong> You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.
<br><br><strong>Gem Flight.</strong> Starting at 5th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest spectral wings on your body. These wings last for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Pureblood Metallic Variant</h2>
As a pureblood metallic, the following trait replaces your Natural Armor trait. You must choose a metallic subrace.
<br><br><strong>Metallic Breath Weapon.</strong> At 5th level, you gain a second breath weapon. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation in a 15-foot cone. The save DC for this breath is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. Whenever you use this trait, choose one:
<ul>
<li><strong>Enervating Breath.</strong> Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of your next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Repulsion Breath.</strong> Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from you and be knocked prone.</li>
</ul>
Once you use your Metallic Breath Weapon, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
<h2>Ravenite Variant</h2>
As a ravenite, the following trait replaces your Natural Armor trait.
<br><br><strong>Vengeful Assault.</strong> When you take damage from a creature in range of a weapon you are wielding, you can use your reaction to make an attack against that creature. You can do this once per short or long rest.

A target automatically succeeds on the save if it can't hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes frightened for 1 minute.
