        <h1>Gnome</h1>
        A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.
<h2>Gnome Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Intelligence score increases by 2.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> Gnomes mature at the same rate as humans, and most are expected to settle into adult life around the age of 40. They can live to 350 years on average, but it's not too uncommon for them to reach 500 years of age.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and weigh around 40 pounds. Your size is Small.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
<br><br><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
<br><br><strong>Gnome Cunning.</strong> You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saves against magic.
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can read, speak, and write Common and Gnomish.
<h2>Subraces</h2>
<h3>Forest Gnome</h3>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Natural Illusionist.</strong> You know the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=518">Minor Illusion</a> cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting modifier for it.
<br><br><strong>Speak with Small Beasts.</strong> Through sound and gestures, you may communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts.
<h3>Rock Gnome</h3>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Artificer's Lore.</strong> Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magical, alchemical, or technological items, you can add twice your proficiency bonus instead of any other proficiency bonus that may apply.
<br><br><strong>Tinker.</strong> You have proficiency with tinker's tools. Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time. When you create a device, choose an item of Adventuring Equipment that costs 20 gp or less. The device replicates the function of that piece of equipment.
<h3>Svirfneblin</h3>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Superior Darkvision.</strong> Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.
<br><br><strong>Stone Camouflage.</strong> You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide in rocky terrain.
<h2>Dragonmarks</h2>
<h3>Mark of Scribing</h3>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Charisma score increases by 1
<br><br><strong>Gifted Scribe.</strong> Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) or an Ability Check involving Calligrapher's Supplies, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the total ability check.
<br><br><strong>Scribe's Insight.</strong> You know the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=511">Message</a> cantrip. You can also cast the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=136">Comprehend Languages</a> spell with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=485">Magic Mouth</a> spell with it. Once you cast either spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell again until you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
<br><br><strong>Spells of the Mark.</strong> If you have the Arcane Wellspring, Spellcasting, or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Scribing Spells table are added to the spell list of your Spellcasting class.

<h2>Racial Feats</h2>
<h3>Fade Away</h3>
Your people are clever, with a knack for illusion magic. You have learned a magical trick for fading away when you suffer harm. You gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
<li>Immediately after you take damage, you can use a reaction to magically become invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force someone to make a saving throw. Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</li>
</ul>
