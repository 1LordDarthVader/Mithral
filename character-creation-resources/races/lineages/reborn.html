        <h1>Reborn</h1>


<p>Death isn’t always the end. The reborn exemplify this, being individuals who have died yet, somehow, still live. Some reborn exhibit the scars of fatal ends, their ashen flesh or bloodless veins making it clear that they’ve been touched by death. Other reborn are marvels of magic or science, being stitched together from disparate beings or bearing mysterious minds in manufactured bodies. Whatever their origins, reborn know a new life and seek experiences and answers all their own.</p>
<h2 id="toc0"><span>Faded Memories</span></h2>
<p>Reborn suffer from some manner of discontinuity, an interruption of their lives or physical state that their minds are ill equipped to deal with. Their memories of events before this interruption are often vague or absent. Occasionally, the most unexpected experiences might cause sensations or visions of the past to come rushing back.</p>
<p>Rather than sleeping, reborn regularly sit and dwell on the past, hoping for some revelation of what came before. Most of the time, these are dark, silent stretches. Occasionally, though, in a moment of peace, stress, or excitement, a reborn gains a glimpse of what came before. When you desire to have such a dreamlike vision, roll on the Lost Memories table to inspire its details.</p>

<h2 id="toc2"><span>Reborn Features</span></h2>
<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase one ability score by 2 and increase a different one by 1, or increase three different ability scores by 1. If you are replacing your race with this lineage, replace any Ability Score Increase you previously had with this.</p>
<p><strong>Size.</strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage.</p>
<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Ancestral Legacy.</strong> If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.</p>
<p>If you don't keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>Deathless Nature.</strong> You have escaped death, a fact represented by the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.</li>
<li>You have advantage on death saving throws.</li>
<li>You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.</li>
<li>You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive, motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Knowledge from a Past Life.</strong> You temporarily remember glimpses of the past, perhaps faded memories from ages ago or a previous life. When you make an ability check that uses a skill, you can roll a d6 immediately after seeing the number on the d20 and add the number on the d6 to the check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. If you are replacing your race with this lineage, you retain any languages you had and gain no new languages.</p>

<h2>Reborn Variant: Revenant</h2>

Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.

<h3>Revenant Features</h3>

As a revenant, the following trait replaces your Knowledge from a Past Life trait.
        
<p>
    <strong>Relentless Nature.</strong> Your DM assigns a goal to you - typically, one related to your character’s death. The goal must be a specific task you can complete, such as slaying an enemy or liberating an area and its people. Until you fulfill that goal, you gain the following benefits:
<ul>
    <li>If you are below half your hit point maximum at the start of your turn, you regain 1 hit point.</li>
    <li>If you die, you return to life 24 hours after death. If your body is destroyed, you reform within 1 mile of the place of your death at a spot determined by the DM. If your equipment was also destroyed, you do not regain it.</li>
    <li>You know the distance and direction between you and any creature involved in your goal, such as a person you seek vengeance against or someone you pledged to defend. This awareness fails if the creature is on another plane of existence.</li>
</ul>
When your goal is complete, you finally find rest. You die and cannot be restored to life.
