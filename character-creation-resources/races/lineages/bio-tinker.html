        <h1>Bio-Tinker</h1>
<p>Called Simic Hybrids in Ravnica, bio-tinkers are scientists who modify their very bodies with biological enhancements.</p>
<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and another ability score of your choice increases by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Age.</strong> Bio-tinkers are created at adulthood. Their maximum life expectancy is probably reduced.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment.</strong> Bio-tinkers' alignments vary from group to group.</p>
<p><strong>Size.</strong> Bio-tinkers are the same size of they race that they were created from.</p>
<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
<p><strong>Ancestral Legacy.</strong> If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.</p>
<p>If you don't keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>Animal Enhancements.</strong> Your body has been altered with animal characteristics. You choose one animal enhancement now and one at 5th level.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manta Glide (1st level).</strong> You have ray-like fins that you use as wings to slow your fall or allow you to glide. When you fall and are not incapacitated, you can subtract up to 100 feet from your fall when calculating your fall damage and can move horizontally 2 feet for every 1 foot you fall.</li>
<li><strong>Nimble Climber (1st level).</strong> You have a climb speed equal to your walk speed.</li>
<li><strong>Underwater Adaptation (1st level).</strong> You can breathe air and water, and you gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acid Spit (5th level).</strong> As an action, you can spray acid from glands in your mouth, targeting one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 8 + you proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. The target takes 2d10 acid damage if they fail. The damage increases to 3d10 at 11th level and 4d10 at 17th level. You can use this up to your Constitution modifier's worth of times per long rest.</li>
<li><strong>Grappling Appendages (5th level).</strong> You have two special appendages growing alongside with your arms. Choose whether they're both claws or tentacles. As an action, you can use one of them to grapple a creature. Each one is also a natural weapon, which you can use to make an unarmed strike with. If you hit, they do 1d8 + your strength modifier bludgeon damage. Immediately after hitting, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action. These appendages are not dexterous enough to use weapons, magic weapons, and other specialized equipment.</li>
<li><strong>Carapace (5th level).</strong> Your skin in places is covered by a thick shell. You gain a +1 to your AC when not wearing heavy armor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and what ever languages your base race would be able to speak.</p>
