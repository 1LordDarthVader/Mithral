<h2 id="toc0"><span>Cereomorphosis Fault</span></h2>
<p>During cereomorphosis, something went wrong which caused your body to be transformed, but your mind to remain intact. While you feel the pull of the elder brain, you are in no way bound by it. However, the mystery of what exactly caused this to happen remains. Roll on or choose an option from the Cereomorphosis Faults table to determine what allowed you to remain free.</p>

<h2 id="toc1"><span>Illithid Traits</span></h2>
<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase one ability score by 2 and increase a different one by 1, or increase three different ability scores by 1. If you are replacing your race with this lineage, replace any Ability Score Increase you previously had with this.</p>
<p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Deep Speech. In addition, you can read and write Qualith, an illithid writing system that is read using their tentacles.</p>
<p><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are an Aberration.</p>
<p><strong>Size.</strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage.</p>
<p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Ancestral Legacy.</strong> If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.</p>
<p>If you don't keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficency in two skills of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>Illithid Psionics.</strong> You know the <a href="../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=481">Mage Hand</a> cantrip, and the hand is invisible when you cast the cantrip with this trait. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <a href="../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=130">Command</a> spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the <a href="../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=205">Detect Thoughts</a> spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells. When you cast them with this trait, they don't require components.</p>
<p><strong>Mind Blast.</strong> You can unleash a special psionic attack known as a mind blast. As an action, you force creatures of your choice within a 15 foot cone to make Intelligence saving throws (DC = 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 1d6 psychic damage and is stunned until the start of their next turn. This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>
<p>You can use your Mind Blast a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h2 id="toc2"><span>Racial Feats</span></h2>
<h3 id="toc3"><span>Expanded Illithid Psionics</span></h3>
<p>Your psionic prowess increases. You can cast the <a href="../../spells/spell.html?spell_id=461">Levitate</a> spell once using your Illithid Psionics trait, and must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
