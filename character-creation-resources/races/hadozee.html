        <h1>Hadozee</h1>
        Hadozees are people with simian features that long ago adapted to live among the tall trees of their home world. They are natural climbers, with feet as dexterous as their hands, even to the extent of having opposable thumbs. Membranes of skin hang loosely from their arms and legs. When stretched taut, these membranes enable a hadozee to glide.
<br><br>The first hadozees were hunted by large natural predators. To survive in this hostile environment, they developed an instinctual sense of community. Today, that same instinct compels many hadozees to cultivate friendships, knowing there is safety in numbers. They are particularly fond of sailing, and many crews on the seas are full of hadozee.
