        <h1>Minotaur</h1>
        Minotaurs are barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling those of bulls. Their horns range in size from about 1 foot long to great, curling weapons easily three times that length. They often ornament their horns with metal rings or sheathe them in metal to protect them from damage.
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Alignment.</strong> Most minotaurs place no stake in qualms of good or evil.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Minotaurs average over 6 feet in height, and they have stocky builds. Your size is Medium.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Horns.</strong> Your horns are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
<br><br><strong>Goring Rush.</strong> Immediately after you use the Dash action on your turn and move at least 20 feet, you can make one melee attack with your horns as a bonus action.
<br><br><strong>Hammering Horns.</strong> Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack as a part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to shove that target with your horns. The target must be within 5 feet of you and no more than one size larger than you. Unless it succeeds on a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, you push it up to 10 feet away from you.
<br><br><strong>Labyrinthine Recall.</strong> You cannot become lost by nonmagical means and you are immune to the Maze spell.
<br><br><strong>Imposing Presence.</strong> You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Intimidation or Persuasion.
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Minotaur.
<h2>Racial Feats</h2>
<h3>Charging Gore</h3>
