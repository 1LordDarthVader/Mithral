        <h1>Halfling</h1>
        The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies. Others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.

<h2>Racial Feats</h2>
<h3>Bountiful Luck</h3>
Your people have extraordinary luck, which you have learned to mystically lend to your companions whenever you see them falter. You're not sure how you do it, you just wish it, and it happens. Surely a sign of fortune's favor!
<ul>
<li>When an ally you can see within 30 feet of you rolls a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to let the ally reroll the die. The ally must use the new roll.</li>
<li>When you use this ability, you can't use your Lucky racial trait before the end of your next turn</li>
</ul>
<h3>Second Chance</h3>
Fortune favors you when someone tries to strike you. You gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Increase your Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
<li>When a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force that creature to reroll. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you roll initiative at the start of combat or until you finish a short or long rest.</li>
</ul>
