        <h1>Bugbear</h1>
        Bugbears rely on stealth and strength to attack, preferring to operate at night. When they're not in battle, bugbears spend much of their time resting or dozing, and bully weaker creatures into doing their bidding. From the viewpoint of the rest of the world, their aggression and savagery are thankfully offset by their rarity and lethargy.
