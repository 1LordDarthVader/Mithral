        <h1>Shifter</h1>
        Shifters are sometimes called the weretouched, as many believe that they are the descendants of humans and lycanthropes. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they cannot fully change shape they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features - a state they call shifting. Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. A shifter walks on the knife's edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?
<h2>Shifter Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> Shifters are quick to mature both physically and emotionally, reaching young adulthood at age 10. They rarely live to be more than 70 years old.
<br><br><strong>Alignment.</strong> Shifters tend toward neutrality, being more focused on survival than concepts of good and evil. A love of personal freedom can drive shifters toward chaotic alignments.

<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

<br><br><strong>Shifting.</strong> As a bonus action, you can assume a more bestial appearance.

You also gain benefits that depend on your shifter subrace, described below. Once you shift, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can read and write Common, Quori, and one other language of your choice.
