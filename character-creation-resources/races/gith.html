        <h1>Gith</h1>
        The warlike githyanki and the contemplative githzerai are a sundered people - two cultures that utterly despise one another. The brutal githyanki are trained from birth as warriors, while the githzerai hone their minds to a razor's edge in their fortresses within Limbo. But before there were githyanki or githzerai, these creatures were a single race enslaved by the illithids.
<br><br>Although they attempted to overthrow their masters many times, their rebellions were repeatedly crushed until a great leader named Gith arose. After much bloodshed, Gith and her followers threw off the yoke of their illithid masters, but another leader named Zerthimon emerged in the aftermath of battle. Zerthimon challenged Gith's motives, claiming that her strict martial leadership and desire for vengeance amounted to little more than another form of slavery for her people. A rift erupted between followers of each leader, and they eventually became the two races whose enmity endures to this day: the Githyanki in the way of Gith, and the Githzerai in the way of Zerthimon.
<br><br>Whether these tall, gaunt creatures were peaceful or savage, cultured or primitive before the illithids enslaved and changed them, none can say. Not even the original name of their race remains from that distant time.
<br><br>The githyanki plunder countless worlds from the decks of their astral vessels and the backs of red dragons. Feathers, beads, gems, and precious metals decorate their armor and weapons - the legendary silver swords with which they cut through their foes. Since winning their freedom from the illithids, the githyanki have become ruthless conquerors under the rulership of their dread lich-queen, Vlaakith.
<br><br>Focused philosophers and austere ascetics, the githzerai pursue lives of rigid order. Lean and muscular, they wear unadorned clothing free of ornamentation, keeping their own counsel and trusting few creatures outside of their own kind. Having turned their backs on their warlike githyanki kin, the githzerai maintain a strict monastic lifestyle, dwelling on islands of order in the vast sea of chaos that is the plane of Limbo.

<h2>Subraces</h2>
<h3>Githghaik</h3>
Though most gith were able to break away from their illithid masters, one hidden colony of illithids managed to be insulated from their rebellion.
<br><br>These illithids, hearing the news of the gith rebellion, modified their servants so that such a thing could never happen. A link to the elder brain was established in each and every one of their minds, and the elder brain became an overwhelmingly controlling force to them.
<br><br>These poor souls would eventually be used as a fighting force, primarily being sent against their own kin. These gith later came to be known as githghaik, meaning &quot;those who serve mind flayers&quot; in the gith language.
<br><br>A handful of githghaik have managed to break the control on their minds and bodies, but these gith still feel the call of the elder brain, and, modified to be the perfect hunter, they have trouble fitting into normal society.
<br><br>The githghaik are largely shunned by githyanki, as even the free ones are seen as dangerous illithid threats. Githzerai have a more favorable opinion of githghaik, and attempt to help individuals break free from the control of the elder brain.
