        <h1>Hobgoblin</h1>
        War is the lifeblood of hobgoblins. Its glories are the dreams that inspire them. Its horrors don't feature in their nightmares. Cowardice is more terrible to hobgoblins than dying, for they carry their living acts into the afterlife. A hero in death becomes a hero eternal.
<h2>Hobgoblin Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> Hobgoblins mature at the same rate as humans and have lifespans similar in length to theirs.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Hobgoblins are between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh between 150 and 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
<br><br><strong>Martial Training.</strong> You are proficient with two martial weapons of your choice and with light armor.
<br><br><strong>Saving Face.</strong> Hobgoblins are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses you finish a long rest.
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.
<h2>Variants</h2>
<h3>Hobgoblin of the Feywild</h3>
As a hobgoblin of the feywild, the following traits replace your Martial Training and Saving Face traits.
<strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
<br><br><strong>Fey Gift.</strong> You can use this trait to take the Help action as a bonus action, and you can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Starting at 3rd level, choose one of the options below each time you take the Help action, whether as a bonus action or an action:
<ul>
<li><strong>Hospitality.</strong> You and the target of your Help action each gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 plus your proficiency bonus.</li>
<li><strong>Passage.</strong> You and the target of your Help action each increase your walking speeds by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Spite.</strong> Until the start of your next turn, the first time you or the target of your Help action hits a creature with an attack roll, that creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll that it makes within the next minute.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Racial Feats</h2>
<h3>Uphold the Legion</h3>
You were born for life in the legion. You gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Increase your Constitution or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
<li>You can deal an extra 2d6 damage to a creature you hit with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally that isn't incapacitated. You can use this trait only once per combat.</li>
