        <h1>Ogre</h1>
        Hulking giants known for their great strength and even greater stupidity, ogres are written off by most as little more than quick-tempered, unsociable, and easily fooled oafs. While this accurately describes many ogres, it does not encompass the totality of their people, and many scholars are still largely ignorant of the rather unfortunate origin of these creatures.
<h2>Ogre Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 3.
<br><br><strong>Vaprak's Mark.</strong> Pick one of your Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ability scores. The chosen ability score is reduced by 3.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> Ogres are considered adults as soon as they can properly fight. They can live to be around 60, but given their generally brutish and conflict-filled lifestyles, the vast majority do not see old age.
<br><br><strong>Alignment.</strong> The unstructured existence of most ogres steer them toward chaos, and their willingness to take what they want at the expense of others is seen as something of an evil tendency.
<br><br><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a Giant.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Ogres tower above non-giants, standing from at about 9 to 10 feet in height and weighing in at around 650 pounds. Your size is Large.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 40 feet.
<br><br><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light. and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
<br><br><strong>Large and In Charge.</strong> You are capable of wielding weapons sized for Large creatures. Large weapons function as normal weapons, except that their damage is increased by 1d4. Such weapons are not common, and must be sought, looted from Large opponents, or specially crafted. Additionally, due to your massive frame, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with any smaller-sized weapons that possess the Finesse property, as well as any smaller-sized Ranged weapons that lack the Heavy property.
<br><br><strong>Might Makes Right.</strong> When interacting with other ogres or giants, if you make an ability check that would normally add your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, you may instead add your Strength modifier to the roll.
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak Common and Giant. The average ogre cannot read or write either of these languages, but there are exceptions.
<h2>Racial Feats</h2>
<h3>Ettin Blood</h3>
Traces of ettin blood run through your veins, making you more resistant to certain mental effects. You have advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious.

<br><br>You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest.
