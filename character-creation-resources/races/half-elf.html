        <h1>Half-Elf</h1>
        Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves.
<h2>Half-Elf Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice each increase by 1.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> Half-elves age at much the same rate as humans, reaching adulthood at the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Half-elves are more or less the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Thanks to your elven heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
<br><br><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can read, speak, and write Common, Elven, and one language of your choice.
<h2>Subraces</h2>
<h3>Vanilla Half-Elf</h3>
<strong>Skill Versatility.</strong> You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.
<h3>Astral Half-Elf</h3>
<strong>Radiant Soul.</strong> When you succeed on a death save, you can regain a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. You can't use this trait again until you finish a long rest.
<h3>Drow Half-Elf</h3>
<strong>Drow Magic.</strong> You know the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=183">Dancing Lights</a> cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=273">Faerie Fire</a> spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=188">Darkness</a> spell once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
<h3>Eladrin Half-Elf</h3>
Unlike full-blooded eladrin, eladrin half-elves are only associated with a single season, which you choose when you create your character.
<br><br><strong>Fey Step.</strong> As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. When you reach 3rd level, your Fey Step gains an additional effect based on your season; if the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. The effects are as follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>Autumn.</strong> Immediately after you use your Fey Step, up to two creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute, or until you or your companions deal any damage to it.</li>
<li><strong>Winter.</strong> When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Spring.</strong> When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.</li>
<li><strong>Summer.</strong> Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage).</li>
</ul>

The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.

If you can see the night sky, you can cast the <a href="../spells/spell.html?spell_id=51">Augury</a> spell without expending a spell slot or material components.
