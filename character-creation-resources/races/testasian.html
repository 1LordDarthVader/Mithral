        <h1>Testasian</h1>
        A place rarely ventured even by powerful tritons is the deepest of ravines in the sea floor. These dark, dismal places are home to a warlike race of beings resembling crabs, covered in thick armor plating and with enormous, brutal claws in place of hands. These people are known as Testasian by tritons, a word that roughly translates to &quot;shelled brute&quot;.
<h2>Testasian Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom scores increase by 1.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> Testasians are biologically immortal, much like the crustaceans they resemble. This means that unless they die of disease or injury, they could hypothetically live forever. However, due to their warlike nature, most testasians only live around fifty years.
<br><br><strong>Alignment.</strong> The belligerence of testasians tends them towards evil, and their sense of honor tends them towards law. Those who deviate from this commonly become legends in various commmunities, when they shrug off mighty blows as part of an adventuring party or military unit.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Testasians stand around 7 feet tall, and commonly weigh around 400 pounds. Your size is medium.
<br><br><strong>Claws.</strong> All testasians, regardless of their size, have deadly claws. Your claws are a natural weapon which deal 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage and can be used to make unarmed strikes.
<br><br><strong>Amphibious.</strong> You can breathe water as well as air, and have a swimming speed of 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Your life living in deepsea trenches has made your eyes very adept in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
<br><br><strong>Brave.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
<br><br><strong>Hard Shell.</strong> Your body is covered in a chitinous exoskeleton that grants you much protection. You cannot wear armor, but your Armor Class is 17 while unarmored. A shield's bonus can be applied as normal.
<br><br><strong>Warrior Culture.</strong> The culture of testasians glorifies battle and powerful warriors. You gain proficiency in the Athletics and Intimidation skills.
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Aquan.
<h2>Racial Feats</h2>
<h3>Testasian Berserker</h3>
You have trained your body to be accustomed to a berserker-like frenzy. You gain the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
<li>Your Hard Shell trait now provides a base AC of 18. As normal, your Dexterity modifier doesn’t affect this number.</li>
<li>As a reaction when you are forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, choose any number of creatures within 5 feet of you. You and those creatures may make Strength saving throws instead of Dexterity saving throws against the effect. Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you’ve finished a short or long rest.</li>
</ul>
