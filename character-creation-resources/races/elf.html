        <h1>Elf</h1>
        Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.
<h2>Elf Features</h2>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
<br><br><strong>Age.</strong> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.
<br><br><strong>Size.</strong> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.
<br><br><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
<br><br><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
<br><br><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
<br><br><strong>Trance.</strong> Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is &quot;trance.&quot; While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
<br><br><strong>Keen Senses.</strong> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven.
<h2>Subraces</h2>
<h3>Astral Elf</h3>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Astral Fire.</strong> You know one of the following cantrips of your choice: Sacred Flame. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.
<br><br><strong>Radiant Soul.</strong> When you succeed on a death save, you can regain a number of hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. You can’t use this trait again until you finish a long rest.
<br><br><strong>Trance Proficiencies.</strong> Whenever you finish a long rest using your Trance trait, you gain two proficiencies, each one with a weapon or a tool of your choice. You mystically acquire these proficiencies by drawing them from shared elven memory, and you retain them until you finish your next long rest.
<h3>Avariel Elf</h3>
<strong>Flight.</strong> You have a flying speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can't be wearing medium or heavy armor.
<br><br><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Auran.
<h3>Drow</h3>
<strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Charisma score increases by 1.
<br><br><strong>Superior Darkvision.</strong> Your darkvision has a range of 120 feet, instead of 60.
<br><br><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity.</strong> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of the attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.
<br><br><strong>Drow Magic.</strong> You know the Darkness spell once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
<br><br><strong>Drow Weapon Training.</strong> You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.
<h3>Eladrin</h3>
When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin's current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.
<br><br>The following tables offer personality suggestions for eladrin of each season. You can roll on the tables or use them as inspiration for characteristics of your own.
