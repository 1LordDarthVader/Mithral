        <h1>Aarakocra</h1>
        Sequestered in high mountains atop tall trees, the aarakocra evoke fear and wonder. Many of these birdfolk hail from the boundless vistas of the Elemental Plane of Air. They are immigrants, refugees, scouts, and explorers, their outposts functioning as footholds in a world both strange and alien.

<h2>Subraces</h2>
<h3>Alia'eet</h3>
To most other races, the Alia'eet are reported to be the only known subrace of Aarakocra, they make up the entirety of their military might. Their scouts and fighters are seen almost exclusively with all encounters with other races. They are typically the only subrace of the Aarakocra that bleed into the material plane, and as such, they are easily mistaken as the only Aarakocra archetype to exist within texts, eyewitness reports and lore books.
<br><br><strong>Appearance.</strong> They are commonly mistaken for eagles given the height that they fly, with white feathered heads and strong curled yellow beaks. The core of their bodies are brown plumage with some extremities containing more white feathers like their posterior crest.

You can use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
<h3>Bubo Vir</h3>
The wise sages of the aarakocra family, these birdfolk are seen as the elders of their tribes. Often they are skilled healers, well versed in the druidic arts and have a quiet respect for nature.

<h3>Anocetta</h3>

If something is colorful, musical or artistic, the equally expressive Anocetta are sure to let their boastful presence be known. They are regularly patrolling to be the life of the party or vying for attention, and can sometimes be garrulous in their ways, but they are eager to please and see cheering-up others as a challenge to always accept.

<h3>Tarius</h3>
The Tarius are known to be skilled runners with very capable ground movement, and capable fighters able to exploit enemies when they are knocked down. They are skittish and quick to run, but typically it is towards the direction of danger not away. Tarius are eager to put a plan to action, usually as there is never a plan to begin with, getting frustrated when a situation isn't dealt with immediately. They are quiet and speak in short bursts and are surprisingly quite pleasant to engage with when they have nothing important on their minds, which are often racing with thoughts.
<br><br><strong>Appearance.</strong> Tarius have stunning facial features, with distinct quill-like black feathers protruding from behind their heads and striking featherless red faces. Their bodies, however have mute grey feathers and a strong border to black plumage on their wingtips and exceptionally long legs, which tend to give the Tarius more height over their other Aarakocra cousins.

<h3>Orvids</h3>
Highly intelligent, stark creatures with a propensity to be overly curious. Their love to harvest arcane lore serendipitously dovetails with an almost unnatural affinity for shiny objects. They have a knack for finding mildly interesting magical trinkets and turn them into personal collections. Orvids are often magic users by consequence of this wanton lust of pretty devices and - despite their wandering eyes and meandering mind - are still considered the smartest of their kind.
